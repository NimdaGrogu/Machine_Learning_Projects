01-03-2019,"Investing   OPEC or the stock market  Oil traders and investors are still having trouble deciding which matters more 
U S  West Texas Intermediate and U K  Brent crude both rose for a second straight day Thursday  but not before another volatile session where equities had as much as say in the direction of oil as the production cuts that OPEC was trying so hard to impress the market with 
Oil prices flipped from a near 2  drop in European trade to rally as much as 2  each in New York s midmorning session before ending off the day s highs  The positive finish was helped by a Bloomberg survey that suggested OPEC s December production had the largest month on month drop in almost two years  A similar Reuters survey said the cartel s November output had the biggest fall since January 2017 
But oil gain s were checked through the day by U S  stock markets diving on news from late Wednesday that Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  was lowering its revenue forecast blaming weakness in China 
U S   WTI settled up 55 cents  or 1 2   at  47 09 per barrel  after a session peak at  47 47 
Brent  the global crude benchmark  was up by 94 cents  or 1 7   at  55 85 per barrel by 3 12 PM ET  20 12 GMT  after rallying as high as  56 30 earlier 
Oil had a volatile start to the year  falling initially on Wednesday before ending more than 2  up on a Bloomberg report suggesting citing a deliberate curtailment by Saudi Arabia of its oil shipments to the United States and China last month to complete OPEC s mission of reducing global supplies by 1 2 million barrels per day over the next six months 
But the OPEC cuts may matter less if China  and by extension the world  is on the cusp of a recession  analysts say 
Global slowdown fears were being pitted against the OPEC cuts  Phil Flynn of the Price Futures Group in Chicago observed in his Thursday note on oil  although he said the cartel  is prepared to do whatever it takes to stabilize prices  even if it means losing some market share to the shale oil producers  
Aside from the stock market and global macro risks  analysts believe that shale  the main component of U S  oil production  will remain the dark horse of the oil market in 2019  Powered by shale s dynamically evolving fracking technology  U S  crude production reached a record high 11 7 million bpd in 2018 and is expected to top 12 million this year 
U S  oilfields contain the light  sweet crude that is perfect for gasoline  not the heavier sour oil from the Middle East that American refineries need for turning out diesel and other middle distillates  But in a market focused on total production numbers  it is U S  crude that is determining price direction 
Ryan Lance  CEO of Conocco Phillips  said in a Bloomberg opinion piece   We expect oil markets to remain volatile  in part driven by flexible North American shale production that can ramp up and down quickly in response to changes in investment levels  
The market will be on the lookout for the American Petroleum Institute s weekly snapshot on U S  oil supply demand for the week ended Dec  28  ahead of official data on Friday from the Energy Information Administration  The EIA is expected to announce a drop of 3 1 million barrels in U S crude inventories last week  after the previous week s slide of less than 50 000 barrels 
Also due on Friday is the U S  jobs report for December  where the Labor Department is expected to cite a nonfarm payrolls growth of 178 000 versus 155 000 in November ",35.99,36.43,35.5,35.55,103544800,-1

Anil Jain  a Michigan State University computer science professor who is an expert on facial recognition  said he was surprised by Wu s claim because Apple has invested heavily in  anti spoofing  technology that makes such hacks very difficult ",35.99,36.43,35.5,35.55,103544800,-1
01-03-2019," Bloomberg     Jerome Powell gave the U S  economy a thumbs up review last month  Since then  the Federal Reserve chairman has received several reasons to temper his assessment 
On one hand  labor data are coming in strong and consumption figures look fine  On the other  the latest manufacturing  housing and market readings have given the central bank further reason to worry  That means when Powell speaks in Atlanta at 10 30 a m  on Friday  he could justify a more cautious tone solely on the basis of observing the data dependent approach he s said the central bank will follow 
 The message he s going to try to convey is that we are not on a preset course here   said Jay Bryson  global economist at  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  in Charlotte  North Carolina  He expects the tone could tilt slightly dovish without actually signaling a pause   They re going to continue to say  we ll watch the incoming data  growth is slowing  financial conditions have tightened  and we ll react accordingly  
For their part  investors see the next move being a cut  according to pricing in interest rate futures contracts  That would be the first such move in a decade 
Here s a run down of the data that have    and haven t    changed since the Fed chief briefed the media on Dec  19 after policy makers raised rates and signaled two more hikes in 2019 
Factory Pain
If there s one place where the data are souring decisively  it s manufacturing  The Institute for Supply Management s factory index dropped by the most since 2008 last month and touched a two year low  While the ISM gauge remains in expansionary territory at 54 1  just 11 of 18 industries reported growth in December  That s the fewest in two years 
Production problems are far reaching  JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM   and IHS Markit s global manufacturing index fell in December to the lowest level since September 2016 as measures of orders and hiring weakened  data showed this week 
Trade uncertainty and concerns about global growth seem to be an important factor in the recent U S  weakness  tariff worries have surfaced repeatedly in Fed surveys  Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL   cut its revenue outlook this week for the first time in nearly two decades thanks to weaker demand in China 
Housing Wobbles
Fed officials watch the housing market because it s an interest rate sensitive sector  and it s been showing signs of cooling for months  That hasn t abated since the Fed last met  the pending home sales index dropped 0 7 percent on a monthly basis in November  compared to an analyst expectation for a 1 percent gain  Home prices are still rising  but the latest S P CoreLogic Case Shiller index showed that gains continue to moderate 
Market Souring
While it s not a real economy measure  the Fed closely watches market volatility because it can feed through to consumer and business sentiment and the real economy  Stocks saw the worst December rout since the Great Depression and a few near term Treasury security yields have crept above their longer term counterparts since Powell s December press conference  a sign that investors were pessimistic about the outlook for growth 
That s enough to make Powell s colleague in Texas  Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan  argue for putting rate increases on hold for the first couple of quarters of 2019 
 This is a very critical time  We need to be very vigilant  We need to be on our toes  And I think patience is a critical tool we should be using during this period  We can get this right    Kaplan told Bloomberg Television in an interview on Thursday 
Inflation Mixed
Inflation hasn t taken a decisive step lower  but the headline index eased to 1 8 percent in November from 2 percent the prior month  That means that both the headline and the less volatile core index are coming in below the Fed s goal  a possible argument for not raising rates  all else equal 
Chaser  the Job Market
Still  with unemployment at 3 7 percent  some economists caution that inflation could move higher if labor shortages begin to bite    that s partly why the Fed hiked rate four times last year 
The labor market has remained relatively impervious to the recent weakness in other data  Initial jobless claims  a key leading indicator of recession  remain very low  The U S  probably added 180 000 jobs in December  based on the median projection in a Bloomberg survey of economists  That s well above the level Fed officials think is necessary to keep the unemployment rate steady  a figure that hovers somewhere below or around 100 000 
The monthly U S  employment report will be released at 8 30 a m  in Washington on Friday    giving Powell two hours to digest the figures before his big appearance ",35.99,36.43,35.5,35.55,103544800,-1

01-03-2019,"By Joori Roh SEOUL  Reuters    In just over a decade  South Korea has spent the equivalent of a small European economy trying to fix its demographic crisis  yet birthrates have dropped to the lowest in the world  This year  President Moon Jae In  who describes himself as a feminist president  is testing a new angle  showing women more respect  At the end of last year  South Korea announced plans to remove some of the disincentives for employing women  allowing both parents to take parental leave at the same time and extending paid paternal leave  Employers also get incentives to allow either parent to work fewer hours   Efforts on gender equality are very timely   said Shin Eun kyung  an economist with the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development  South Korea is the worst place for women to work in the OECD  despite women being among the organization s best educated  and more highly so than men  But the measures go beyond the workplace  mothers can choose to give the baby their own last name and a tickbox on birth certificates showing whether a baby was born outside marriage will be removed   Fertility treatments will be offered to single women and unmarried couples as well  Social campaigns will encourage men to participate more in child care and household chores  Contrast that with a 2016 effort by the previous government  run by the country s first woman president  Park Geun hye  which launched a website carrying a real time statistical heatmap of women of child bearing age  marriages and births in the hope of spurring competition between cities and regions   The website was taken down after one day  with women complaining it made them feel like  reproductive organs    The country sees women as baby factories   says Hong Sook young  who produces the country s most popular children TV show  Asked about the latest measures  Hong said  at least pretending to hear what people really want is a start toward change     Graphic  South Korea birth rates versus the world     TEMPLE BONDING South Korea s demographic time bomb is ticking louder  The government s latest forecast sees its population declining from 2027  and a presidential committee said the country s economic growth potential could fall to below 1 percent  Birth rates have long been a policy priority  since 2006  the government has spent 152 9 trillion won   135 65 billion    about the size of an economy like Hungary or Nevada   on perks for families and subsidies for children from birth through university and beyond  Last year s 26 3 trillion low birth policy budget was more than half the defense spending of a country technically still at war with its northern neighbor   But demographic experts say money is not the main issue  the experience of advanced countries with higher birth rates  such as France or Sweden  shows gender equality plays a crucial role   The previous allocation of resources drew criticism as well  The government went far beyond child allowances and subsidizing care and education  For instance  it funded temple stays for family bonding and financed youth seeking brief jobs abroad   Many such programs will end  with the 2019 birth support budget cut by a quarter  to 20 5 trillion won   It should have been cut a long time ago   said Jung Jae hoon  social welfare professor at Seoul Women s University  Jung cautioned  however  the signal the government was finally sending will take a long time to filter through the conservative east Asian society  Births outside marriage  for instance  are so widely frowned upon that they amount to only 1 9 percent of the total  the lowest anywhere  Experts compare that to France  where the ratio is over 50 percent and the birth rate is 1 9 versus South Korea s 1 05  Abortion is illegal and adoption rules very strict   The stigma of out of wedlock babies has seen Seoul s Jusarang Community Church build an oven sized  baby box   with cushions and a heating system into its outside wall   Last year  261 children were abandoned across the country  according to Statistics Korea  JOBS FOR MEN About 56 percent of women aged 15 64 work in South Korea  below the OECD average of almost 60 percent  and 72 75 percent in Denmark and Sweden  where birth rates are among the highest of advanced economies  Recruiters say married young women are less likely to get job opportunities due to discrimination   In November  the Supreme Court upheld a four year jail sentence against a former CEO of state run Korea Gas Safety Corp over manipulating interview scores to knock women out of the hiring process   While Samsung Electronics  KS 005930  has a more balanced gender ratio than Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   globally  with women accounting for 45 percent of the staff versus a third at its U S  rival  only one in four staff at its Korea headquarters are women  None of the nine board members at  Hyundai Motor  Co  KS 005380  are women  versus six out of 12 at General Motors  N GM    The whole period of before  during and after childbirth weighs on our career   said a female assistant manager at Hyundai Motor  The pay gap between sexes only makes it harder  she added  South Korea s gender wage gap is highest among advanced countries at 34 6 percent  above OECD average of 13 8 percent   A Hyundai Motor spokeswoman said the firm was committed to providing equal opportunities to all employees and opposes discrimination  A Samsung Electronics spokeswoman said the company has been recruiting more females  including in managerial positions  and that most staff return to work after parental leave and its daycare centers can look after 3 000 children  WEAK ECONOMY Still  critics say while Moon s approach to birth rates is an improvement  his job and housing policies discourage parenthood  Minimum wage hikes have led to higher unemployment  while larger downpayment requirements have made homes unaffordable for many    Creating a structure that enables us to have our own house is mostly needed   said Lee Kyoung min  a store manager at Lotte Mart  a father of three  Some also argue work life balance could be better  Moon in July cut the working week to 52 hours from 68  but South Koreans still work 15 percent longer than the OECD average  If birth rates don t improve  South Korea s economy could be 5 percent smaller by 2060  as

Meanwhile  Brent crude futures  the benchmark for oil prices outside the U S   inched back one cent  or 0 02   to  54 92  after having declined as far as  53 95 
Crude prices marked intraday lows as an interview between Hassett and CNN hit the wires in which he said that there would likely be  a heck of lot of companies  that are going to be watching their earnings downgraded until there s a deal with China 
Markets have been cautious as the prospect for slower global economic growth would have a negative effect on oil prices due to the potential for softer petroleum demand 
China s manufacturing sector saw a contraction in December  with weakness attributed to the ongoing trade tensions with the U S 
In his remarks  Hassett was confident that  although the current situation meant lower earnings for American companies in the short term  the economic downturn would pile pressure on China to make a trade deal 
 If we have a successful negotiation with China  then Apple s sales and everybody else s sales will recover     But right now China is feeling the blow really of our tariffs   Hassett emphasized

environment like that  the yen tends to thrive  Japan s large current account surplus means global markets consider it a safe haven  Global surveys this week showed activity in European and Chinese factories are slowing  And falling demand forced Apple  O AAPL  to issue a rare cut in its sales forecast  sending tremors through global markets  The yen s roaring higher was a sign of just how

savings overseas  then bring the money home during extreme market stress  driving the yen higher  That outward investment pressure has only surged in recent years  According to  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS   foreign investments in U S  assets has nearly doubled over the last decade to  1 25 trillion    a sign of the magnitude of the flows that could head back into the yen   The dollar collapsed to as little as 104 10 yen   its lowest reading since March 2018 in early Asian trading  before recouping some losses to stand at 107 64 yen  The yen strengthened at least 1 percent against all its G10 peers At session lows  the Japanese currency has gained more than 6 5 percent in the last five trading sessions and is the best performing major currency since early December   But even as evidence mounts that the global economy is struggling  central banks  led by the United States  are signaling more interest rate increases are coming  That is raising fears they may be tightening policy too much into an economic slowdown   It tells you there is a lot of anxiety and nervousness and concern about a more material slowdown in the economy   said Bob Michele  chief investment officer and head of fixed income at JP Morgan Asset Management   Real U S  interest rates adjusted for inflation are at their highest in nearly three years  Nominal interest rates are greater than dividend yields in U S   China and Japan   U S  real yields are too high  productivity problems are emerging in China and the glut of global surpluses is falling  exposing structural flaws in developed markets   said Hans Redeker  global head of FX strategy at Morgan Stanley in London   Graphic  Japan Portfolio investments     SAFER SAFE HAVEN Unusually though  this time around  the surge in the yen has occurred a few months after a selloff in emerging markets last summer  That suggests the bulk of Japanese investment is concentrated in developed markets such as the United States  Between late March and early October  U S  stocks rose by 13 percent and the dollar gained more than 9 percent against the yen as rate increases in the United States and trade tensions boosted the U S  currency  Sam Lynton Brown  a currency strategist at  BNP Paribas   PA BNPP  in London  said Japanese investors typically held much of their investments in developed markets and the widening cracks in developed markets resulted in the yen s strongly exhibiting its safe haven characteristics only in recent weeks  Morgan Stanley strategists said Japanese investors have stepped up buying of riskier U S  assets such as equities and credit in recent weeks to capture higher yields  Since 2010  they have added more than  400 billion in U S  assets  most of it in equities  they said  With Japan s financial market still closed for new year s holidays  the latest moves have been credited to retail investors  Those investors generally behaved like the rest of the FX market bar exceptional circumstances  said Commerzbank s Leuchtmann   Graphic  JPY valuations     PAINFUL DISLOCATIONS Emerging market currencies such as Turkey s lira and South Africa s rand felt the biggest pain   The lira  TRYUSD R  tumbled more than 7 percent overnight against the yen  The rand  ZARJPY R  dropped nearly 4 percent  Investors have been nervous about both countries  which rely heavily on foreign investors to plug their gaping current account deficits    These dislocations demonstrate the impact of unwinding QE on market structures and it means that the truly more vulnerable markets out there need to watch their back  so to speak   said Koon Chow at UBP   Graphic  Lira  Rand vs Yen     Japanese investors  who had cut back on their protection against currency moves  are also expected to take advantage of reduced hedging costs and protect their overseas portfolios from further losses    a move that market watchers say may be the catalyst for further gains   Even if the yen consolidates around these levels in the near term  we think it will continue to strengthen on balance in 2019   said BNP Paribas s Lynton Brown  who expects the dollar to weaken to 100 yen by the end of the year   For Jane Foley  a currency strategist at

01-03-2019,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  manufacturing activity slowed sharply to a two year low in December amid a plunge in new orders and hiring at factories  suggesting the economy was probably not immune to slowing growth in China and Europe   The Institute for Supply Management  ISM  survey published on Thursday offered a downbeat assessment of the manufacturing sector  with almost all components declining last month  Concerns about the economy s health are escalating despite the labor market remaining strong   The economy is just going to be spinning its wheels with subpar growth in 2019 if the purchasing managers report is to be believed   said Chris Rupkey  chief economist at MUFG in New York   New orders have dried up and this will take a toll on business investment and growth in 2019   The Institute for Supply Management  ISM  said its index of national factory activity tumbled 5 2 points to 54 1 last month  the lowest reading since November 2016   The drop was the largest since October 2008  when the economy was in the throes of a recession  A reading above 50 in the ISM index indicates an expansion in manufacturing  which accounts for about 12 percent of the U S  economy  The ISM said that demand had  softened   It said while consumption continued to strengthen  with production and employment still expanding  this was  at much lower levels compared to prior periods    The ISM s new orders sub index plunged 11 points to 51 1 last month  the lowest reading since August 2016  The survey s factory employment measure dropped to 56 2 in December from 58 4 in the prior month  Tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on steel and aluminum imports as well as a range of Chinese goods are hurting manufacturers  Transportation equipment manufacturers said  customer demand continues to decrease due to concerns about the economy and tariffs   Machinery makers complained that  the ongoing open issues with tariffs between U S  and China are causing longer term concerns about costs and sourcing strategies for our manufacturing operations   Computer and electronic product manufacturers said  growth appears to have stopped   President Donald Trump has defended the duties as necessary to protect American industries from what he says is unfair foreign competition  The White House s protectionism has lead to a trade war with China and tit for tat tariffs with other trading partners  including the European Union  Canada and Mexico  In addition to the tariffs  which have raised input costs for manufacturers  factory activity is also being undercut by a strong dollar  a shortage of skilled workers  a fading fiscal stimulus and slowing growth in economies like China  Data this week showed factory activity weakened across much of Europe and Asia in December  with Chinese manufacturing contracting for the first time in 19 months  Apple  O AAPL  on Wednesday cut its sales forecast for its quarter ending in December  citing slowing iPhone sales in China  U S  stocks extended losses on the weak ISM survey  with the Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJI  falling more than 600 points at one point  The dollar dropped against a basket of currencies  while U S  Treasury yields fell  SLOWING ECONOMY The sharp stock market sell off has raised the specter of a significant slowdown in growth this year  though economists see no recession  Some economists believe that the resulting tightening in financial market conditions could discourage the Federal Reserve from further raising interest rates this year  The Fed increased borrowing costs last month for the fourth time in 2018  but forecast fewer rate hikes this year and signaled its tightening cycle is nearing an end in the face of financial market volatility and slowing global growth  Despite signs of slowing economic growth  the labor market appears strong  The ADP  NASDAQ ADP  National Employment Report on Thursday showed private payrolls jumped 271 000 last month after increasing 157 000 in November   Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls advancing 178 000 last month  The ADP report  which is jointly developed with Moody s Analytics  was published ahead of the government s more comprehensive employment report for December scheduled for release on Friday  The ADP report has a spotty record predicting the private payrolls component of the government s employment report and last month s surge probably exaggerates the strength of the labor market because of a seasonal quirk    The ADP employment report has been susceptible to large swings in December that we think may be in part due to a year end quirk that has tended to result in ADP printing high relative to payrolls in the final month of the year   said John Ryding  chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York  Still  other labor market indicators were strong in December  including consumers  perceptions of the job market  According to a Reuters survey of economists  nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 177 000 jobs last month after rising 155 000 in November  The unemployment rate is forecast steady near a 49 year low of 3 7 percent  With the labor market viewed at being at or beyond full employment  the pace of job growth is slowing as employers struggle to find workers  Some of the moderation in employment gains has been attributed to the stock market rout  A third report from the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 10 000 to a seasonally adjusted 231 000 for the week ended Dec  29  Claims have now increased for three straight weeks   Claims data tends to be noisy around year end holidays  The four week moving average of initial claims  considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week to week volatility  slipped 500 to 218 750 last week  
 The claims data suggest that conditions in the labor market have softened relative to a few months ago when the claims readings were very upbeat  but the extent of any deterioration is not entirely obvious and does not look extreme at this point   said Daniel Silver  an economist at JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  in New York ",35.99,36.43,35.5,35.55,103544800,1

01-03-2019,"By Stephen Nellis  Munsif Vengattil and Adam Jourdan SAN FRANCISCO BENGALURU SHANGHAI  Reuters    Apple Inc on Wednesday took the rare step of cutting its quarterly sales forecast  with Chief Executive Tim Cook blaming slowing iPhone sales in China  whose economy has been dragged down by uncertainty around U S  China trade relations  The news  which comes as a spotlight grows on Beijing s attempts to revive stalling growth  sent Apple shares  NASDAQ AAPL  tumbling in after hours trade  hammered Asian suppliers and triggered a broader selloff in global markets  The revenue drop for the just ended quarter underscores how an economic slowdown in China has been sharper than many expected  catching companies and leaders in Beijing off balance and forcing some to readjust their plans in the market   While we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets  we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration  particularly in Greater China   Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a letter to investors  Apple finds itself in a tricky position in China  a key market for sales and where it manufactures the bulk of the iconic products it sells worldwide  after the high profile arrest in Canada of the CFO of domestic rival Huawei Technologies Co Ltd  HWT UL   Since the arrest last month  at the request of the United States  there have been sporadic reports of Chinese consumers shying away from Apple products  Even before then  local rivals like Huawei had been gaining market share over Apple  Cook told CNBC that Apple products have not been targeted by the Chinese government  though some consumers may have elected not to buy an iPhone or other Apple devices due to the firm being an American brand   The much larger issue is the slowing of the  Chinese  economy  and then the trade tension that has further pressured it   Cook said  PRICE TAG Some analysts  however  questioned the impact of Apple s own actions  such as its unyielding pursuit of high selling prices for its products   Apple sales in China have not been doing well for a few quarters now  part of the reason is that their price points have gone too high   past the  1 000 mark   said Kiranjeet Kaur  an analyst at market research firm IDC    That s  almost three times as expensive as phones from other vendors that are filling the mass market   China s smartphone market has dropped sharply this year  with Apple and South Korean rival Samsung Electronics  KS 005930  Co Ltd leading the fall  even as some domestic peers have performed more strongly   Apple  Samsung lead China smartphone drop    Samsung said last month it would cease operations at one of its mobile phone manufacturing plants in China  after seeing its share of the Chinese market drop to 1 percent in the first quarter of 2018 versus 15 percent in mid 2013  FORECAST CUT Apple on Wednesday lowered its forecast to  84 billion in revenue for its fiscal first quarter ended Dec  29  below analysts  estimate of  91 5 billion  according to IBES data from Refinitiv  Apple originally forecast revenue of between  89 billion and  93 billion  This marked the first time Apple had issued a warning on its revenue guidance ahead of releasing quarterly results since the iPhone was launched in 2007  Apple shares skidded 7 7 percent in after hours trade  dragging the company s market value below  700 billion  In the broader market  the S P 500 futures fell 1 5 percent  In the U S  government bond market  a typical safe haven  the yield on the benchmark 10 year  which moves inversely to the bond s price  sank to an 11 month low  PRECURSORS TO A WARNING Apple s move was not entirely a surprise  In November  the Cupertino  California based company said it would quit disclosing unit sales data for iPhones and other hardware items  leading many analysts to worry that a drop in iPhone sales was coming  And after several component makers in November forecast weaker than expected sales  some market watchers called the peak for iPhones in several key markets  In November  Cook cited slowing growth in emerging markets such as Brazil  India and Russia for lower than anticipated sales estimates for the company s fiscal first quarter  But Cook specifically said he  would not put China in that category  of countries with troubled growth  That all came before the damage to the Chinese economy from trade tensions with the United States and long simmering structural issues became evident  Apple is now the highest profile multinational corporation to warn that the economic slowdown in China could hurt its business  Automakers such as Ford Motor  NYSE F  Co  Hyundai Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co Ltd all previously said they planned to cut production in the country  But Apple has held firm on its premium pricing strategy in China despite the risk of a slower economy   The question for investors will be the extent to which Apple s aggressive pricing has exacerbated this situation and what this means for the company s longer term pricing power within its iPhone franchise   James Cordwell  an analyst at Atlantic Equities  told Reuters  In the latest fiscal year  ended Sept  29  unit sales of the iPhone were essentially flat from the prior year  while iPhone revenue expanded 18 percent to  166 7 billion  That growth came entirely from higher prices  Hal Eddins  chief economist at Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel  said Cook s comments on the impact of the U S  trade tensions with China  might be a dig at  U S  President Donald  Trump  but mostly he may be using the trade turmoil as an excuse for some missteps they ve made over the last year   But some investors were heartened by Apple s plans on using its cash pile  In his letter  Cook said Apple has  130 billion in net cash and that it intends to continue its efforts to reduce that cash balance to net zero  which the company has so far accomplished through dividend increases and share buybacks  
 We would anticipate the company increasing share buybacks on the weakness to return capital to shareholders at discount prices   said Trip Miller  managing partner at Apple shareholder Gullane Capital Partners ",35.99,36.43,35.5,35.55,103544800,-1

1  Apple plunges after slashing revenue forecast
Shares in Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  plunged nearly 8  in premarket trade on Thursday after the iPhone maker slashed its quarterly revenue forecast as U S  Sino trade tensions hit sales in China 
Chief executive officer Tim Cook said the company expects sales of about  84 billion in the quarter ended Dec  29  down from earlier estimates of  89 billion to  93 billion 
 While we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets  we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration  particularly in Greater China   Cook said in a letter to investors 
 It s clear that the economy began to slow there  in China  for the second half and what I believe to be the case is the trade tensions between the United States and China put additional pressure on their economy   Cook explained in an interview with CNBC 
Wall Street analysts reacted to the news by cutting price targets for Apple by more than 15  
2  Yen undergoes overnight  flash crash  in currency markets
The scare from Apple sent investors scrambling for the safe haven yen which surged against all major rivals in overnight trade 
Traders  referring to the event as the first flash crash of 2019  explained that the lack of liquidity during twilight hours was exacerbated by the fact that markets in Tokyo were closed for the last day of its new year holiday break and algorithmic trading 
In a matter of minutes  the yen surged across the board  reserving some of its biggest gains against the traditional high yielding currencies favored by domestic retail investors such as the Australian dollar and the Turkish lira 
USD JPY fell as low as 105 00 before paring losses and was last off 1 1  at 107 63 by 5 53 AM GMT  10 53 GMT  
3  Stocks retreat as Apple s woes dampen sentiment
Although U S  stocks managed to kick off 2019 with a small rebound after the worst December since the Great Depression  Apple s surprise announcement was enough to return bearish sentiment to global stock markets  U S  futures pointed to a negative open on Wall Street with the Dow on track for triple digit decline  At 5 54 AM ET  10 54 GMT   the blue chip Dow futures fell 352 points  or 1 51   S P 500 futures lost 42 points  or 1 65   while the Nasdaq 100 futures traded down 172 points  or 2 70

4  Democrats seek to halt government shutdown  little hope for Trump acceptance
As the partial U S  government shutdown headed for a 13th straight day  Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives planned to try and pass a bill on Thursday that would provide temporary funding for federal services to reactivate 
The bill however would not include funding for the Mexican border wall  a necessary condition for U S  President Donald Trump to accept the plan 
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday that Senate Republicans would not approve a proposal that Trump does not support 
Expectations have shifted to Friday when congressional leaders are set to resume talks with Trump 
5  Oil prices decline as attention shifts to U S  inventories
Oil prices fell on Thursday as stock market turmoil and global growth worries dampened appetite for risk assets and investors turned their attention to the latest weekly readings on U S  inventories

01-03-2019," Bloomberg     Apple Inc  cut its revenue outlook for the first time in almost two decades citing weaker demand in China  triggering a slump for Asian suppliers and a wave of lower price targets on Wall Street 
Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said sales will be about  84 billion in the quarter ended Dec  29  down from earlier estimates of  89 billion to  93 billion  Apple posted sales of  88 3 billion in the fiscal first quarter a year earlier  so the new forecast would mean Apple is reporting a holiday quarter slowdown for the first time since Cook became CEO in 2011 
Shares of Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  were down 7 8 percent in pre market trading at 05 37 a m  in New York Thursday 
The announcement  made in a letter from Cook to investors  comes after weeks of signals from inside Apple and its supply chain indicating the Cupertino  California based company is struggling to sell the latest iPhones released in September  The flagship product earns Apple about two thirds of its revenue  and allows the company to generate more money from attached products like Apple Watches  AirPods  and services like Apple Music 
 While we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets  we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration  particularly in Greater China   Cook wrote  Greater China  a region that includes the mainland  Hong Kong and Taiwan  accounted for most of the revenue shortfall  but iPhone upgrades also weren t as strong as the company anticipated in some developed markets  Cook said 
 The fact that they missed that wasn t the shock   said Daniel Ives  an analyst at Wedbush Securities   It was the degree and how confined it was to China  The fact that China basically fell off a cliff was a jaw dropper  and combined with the lack of metrics  it makes investors feel like they re walking blindfolded in the dark  
Suppliers in Europe and Asia slumped on the news  AMS AG  which produces optical sensors for mobile phones  fell as much as 19 4 percent in Zurich  and Dialog Semiconductor Plc  which makes power management components  fell as much as 8 5 percent in Frankfurt 
 SK Hynix Inc   KS 000660   a producer of memory for Apple  dropped 4 8 percent in Seoul while Samsung Electronics  KS 005930  Co   which makes chips and displays  fell 3 percent  IPhone assembler  Hon Hai  Precision Industry Co Ltd  TW 2317  lost 1 7 percent and rival  Pegatron  Corp  TW 4938   slipped 1 2 percent   Taiwan Semiconductor Co Ltd   TWO 5425  fell 1 8 percent 
Several key Apple suppliers overseas had cut their revenue estimates during the past few months  suggesting something was amiss  In November  the company said it would stop reporting unit sales of iPhones  iPads and Macs beginning in fiscal 2019  That sparked concern Apple wanted to avoid disclosing weak growth numbers  Apple s stock had fallen 32 percent from an October peak to its close of  157 92 Wednesday amid growing concerns about the iPhone 
In December  Bloomberg News reported the company was facing a  fire drill  to boost iPhone sales  That led Apple to aggressively market the iPhone XR on its website for  449  about  300 less than its official sticker price  The deal required customers to trade in an iPhone 7 Plus  a high end handset from two years earlier 
At least four Wall Street firms  including BITG and RBC  lowered their share price forecasts by more than 15 percent after Cook s letter 
In his letter  Cook said the new iPhone models were released earlier than the flagship iPhone X last year  which created a difficult year over year comparison  The iPhone X launched in November 2017  while the iPhone XS and XS Max were released in September  Cook also noted supply constraints to new models of the Apple Watch  iPad Pro and AirPods 
 IPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be   he said  meaning the sales of new models to current customers replacing their old phones 
The CEO attributed much of the company s  shortfall  in its outlook to struggles in China that he pinned on the economy and  rising trade tensions  with the U S 
 As the climate of mounting uncertainty weighed on financial markets  the effects appeared to reach consumers as well  with traffic to our retail stores and our channel partners in China declining as the quarter progressed   Cook said 
The timing of Apple s announcement blaming its shortcomings partly on President Donald Trump s trade war with China may increase pressure on American officials to ease the tensions quickly  Mid level officials from the Trump administration are scheduled to travel to Beijing for talks early next week 
While iPhone revenue accounted for the forecast cut  Apple s other product categories  including the iPad and services  grew a combined 19 percent year over year  he said  Services generated  10 8 billion in revenue for the quarter    a 27 percent increase from a year earlier 
Apple s decision to cut its sales outlook   isn t a huge shock at this point   said Shannon Cross of Cross Research   It will be interesting to see how Apple shares react if there s a China trade agreement  ",35.99,36.43,35.5,35.55,103544800,-1

01-04-2019," Reuters    Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them 
1  GROWING PESSIMISM
If you wanted evidence that the U S  economy could be rolling over  the surprise miss on the Institute for Supply Management s closely watched manufacturing index was it  Wall Street and Treasury yields slumped after the ISM index turned in its largest drop since the financial crisis in 2008  and investors now bet that the Fed is more likely to cut rates this year than raise them 
But manufacturing isn t the big weight in the U S  economy it used to be  Services now account for roughly 80 percent of economic activity  and investors will be watching closely on Monday to see if ISM s barometer of that key sector delivers solace or more pain  It is expected to dip modestly to a reading of 59 7 from 60 7 in November  a reading above 50 indicates activity is growing   but the risk is that it turns in a downside surprise like the manufacturing index 
2  FLASH CRASH
With the brewing China U S  trade war biting into global growth already and liquidity tightening around the world  2019 was always going to be a stressful year  But nobody expected it to start with a currency market  flash crash  that briefly pushed dollar yen below 105 00  The move was attributed to automatic sell triggers in thin markets  but it would have fully reversed by now if investors saw no fundamental justification to it  Poor manufacturing surveys in Asia  Europe and the United States and a sales warning from Apple might go a long way in explaining the move 
The yen s strength is a red flag for world markets  but a massive domestic problem as well  It hurts Japanese exports and the Bank of Japan  which only months ago looked keen to normalize policy  may see it as a risk to its decades long efforts to create inflation  Indeed  on their first day back to work  BOJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda echoed ECB chief Mario Draghi s  whatever it takes  comment and top FX diplomat Masatsugu Asakawa reminded FX traders of past G7 and G20 coordination on intervention  Such reminders may get louder in the coming days and weeks 
3  BACK TO SCHOOL  5 DAY RULE
There s no denying it  it s been a rocky start to the year for world markets  Just how rocky the ride is for the rest of 2019 remains to be seen  of course  but it might be worth keeping an eye on one of investors  quirky market guidelines for clues  the so called  S P Five Day Rule  
It s a  rule  often touted by ex Goldman bigwig Jim O Neill  and goes like this  when the S P 500 rises in the first five trading days of the year  the market turns in a positive annual performance  O Neill puts the success rate of this rule of thumb since 1950 at more than 85 percent  According to the Stock Trader s Almanac  as the S P 500 goes over the full month of January  so goes the full calendar year  In the last 70 years there have been 10 major errors  1966  1968  1982  2001  2003  2009  2010  2015  and of course 2018 
The S P 500 usually goes up  In the last 91 years the index has risen in 62 of them and fallen in 29 of them  At the time of writing  after only two full trading days of 2019  the index is down 2 35 percent  Plenty of time for a turnaround  but sentiment is most definitely bearish 
4 CHIP WRECK
It was a rotten week for Apple after boss Tim Cook warned that China s economic slowdown has caught the company off guard and trade tensions between Washington and Beijing were starting to hurt consumer spending on smartphones in the world s 2nd largest economy 
Cook s bombshell fueled worries that Apple s relatively pricey smartphones may be falling out of favor in China  where rivals such as Huawei offer cheaper options  Apple shares  NASDAQ AAPL  tumbled 10 percent on Thursday   a remarkable fall for one of the world s most valuable and liquid stocks   resulting in the S P Technology index s worst day since August 2011 
It deepened the recent equities rout and cemented the increasingly gloomy picture for corporate earnings  the early indications of which will become clearer in the upcoming earnings season that kicks off later this month  Analysts  outlook is already pretty bleak  estimated earnings growth for world technology stocks 12 months ahead is just 5 6 percent  its lowest since April 2009 
5  WILL THEY  WON T THEY 
The start of the year is normally a busy time for sovereign debt issuers  especially developing nations  Emerging market debt has risen steadily in recent years  and pay back time is approaching  over  4 trillion of EM debt matures by the end of 2020  of which around a third is denominated in foreign currency  according to the Institute of International Finance 
But it might be different this year  Worries over global growth are deepening and sending tremors through world markets  dampening investors  appetite for riskier assets and making it harder and more expensive for EM issuers to roll over debt and borrow 
Analysts at Citi expect EM spreads to continue widening due to  increased anxiety about the end of the economic cycle in the U S   uncertainty about damage caused by the Fed s tightening  and a lack of clarity regarding China U S  trade disputes   It s shaping up to be a quieter start to the year as governments weigh their options and wait on the sidelines for an opportune moment  Yet some are still planning to make an appearance  Israel will start its investor roadshow in Europe on Monday ",36.13,37.14,35.95,37.06,111448000,-1
01-04-2019,"By David Randall NEW YORK  Reuters    After emerging market stocks led global equity markets lower in a brutal 2018  some U S  based fund managers are betting that the asset class may have the largest rebound in the new year  It may not look likely at the moment  given that an economic downturn in China prompted iPhone maker Apple Inc  O AAPL  to lower its quarterly revenue forecast on Wednesday for the first time in a decade  Its shares slumped nearly 10 percent after Chief Executive Tim Cook blamed the U S  China trade war and  economic deceleration   prompting broad selloffs around the world the following day  Yet fund managers from Westwood Holdings Group  GMO  T  Rowe Price and Causeway Capital Management are among those who are betting that emerging market stocks will post outsized gains in 2019  They cite a combination of compelling valuations and a likely decline in the value of the dollar that will help accelerate economic growth   As China continues to bear the brunt of U S  President Donald Trump s focus on trade tariffs  fund managers are expecting that shares in countries like India  Thailand  Peru  and Brazil will outperform the China dominated emerging market benchmark index    We want to lean into the fear in the markets   said Sebastien Page  head of asset allocation at T  Rowe Price  He expects emerging markets will outperform in the year ahead as the Federal Reserve curtails its pace of interest rate hikes and the dollar subsides    When you have a recovery in risk assets  those that have been undervalued can snap back the most   he said   Emerging markets have been in a bear market since September  placing them already four months into the deep declines that rocked the U S  equities market in December  The average bear market in emerging markets has lasted 220 days and posted a decline of 32 4 percent  or about 7 percentage points more than the roughly 25 percent drop in the MSCI Emerging Market Index since it hit near record highs last January  according to data from Ned Davis Research   While emerging markets started the year with another roughly 1 7 percent loss over the first two trading sessions  fund managers say they are increasing their bets on stocks in countries that are among the most beaten down  expecting they will have the largest rebound if and when a global bull market in equities resumes    I m actually a lot more positive than this time last year because there are tremendous opportunities to add to high quality names in insurance and some banks   said Patricia Perez Coutts  portfolio manager of the Westwood Emerging Markets fund  She has been increasing her stakes in South Africa  Thailand and Peru  she said  with the largest positions in companies such as South African life insurance company Sanlam Ltd  J SLMJ  and  Credicorp Ltd   N BAP   Peru s largest financial holding company  Shares of Credicorp are up 8 8 percent over the last 12 months  while shares of Sanlam are down 3 9 percent over the same time  Perez Coutts has been underweight China since the start of last year  though she is starting to wade back in by buying shares in gaming and e commerce companies that have plunged    Though China s overall economy may not be growing as strongly as it did in the past  there are still areas of strong growth   she said   Joe Gubler  a quantitative portfolio manager at Causeway Capital Management  says emerging markets remain a compelling opportunity with a forward price to earnings ratio of approximately 10 even after the recent declines in the U S  market have pushed the forward price to earnings ratio of the S P 500 to slightly below 15 for the first time in about 5 years   As a result  Gubler has been increasing his positions in small cap companies in India  as well as energy companies that have sold off as the price of oil has tanked  He has also been increasing his position in companies that could benefit if there is a breakthrough in global trade talks    The market is not in a mood to give emerging market stocks much credit   he said   If you look at the chart  the emerging market index is sitting at about the same place it was in 2009

01-04-2019,"By Howard Schneider and Jonathan Spicer ATLANTA NEW YORK  Reuters    Weak sales at Apple and Cargill  U S  giants of technology and agriculture  may be the clearest sign yet that President Donald Trump s quest to reset world trade carries costs at home and could isolate the United States as the increasingly fragile engine for global economic growth   Apple  a global technology darling loved for its sleek gadgets  on Wednesday warned of disappointing quarterly revenues because of poor sales in China  On Thursday  privately held grains trader Cargill announced worse than expected results out of China  China  the world s second largest economy  likely expanded at more than 6 percent last year  reflecting a slowdown from years past and  in recent months  its most tepid rate since the depths of the global financial crisis a decade ago  The U S  China trade war threatens a decade old hope among business and economic leaders that rising purchasing power among Chinese consumers would support an era of synchronized global growth   The sharp slowdown in China and weakness elsewhere also threaten to leave U S  consumers  whose spending accounts for more than two thirds of U S  economic activity and who so far have been eager to spend in an era of rising household incomes and wages  as the chief bulwark against a broader world downturn   There is an inconsistency between the U S  acting as a locomotive for the world and the objective of the Trump administration s policy to reduce the trade deficit  That s another reason why it will be challenging for the U S  consumer to act as world locomotive   said Catherine Mann  global chief economist at Citi and the OECD s former chief economist    We are looking at this balance between the strong domestic activity and the weaker external activity   in the United States  Germany and elsewhere  she said  and also the  effectiveness of Chinese policy to turn the trajectory of the economy there    Other drivers of U S  growth  including government and business spending and net exports  are all sagging or expected to do so in coming months   The U S  economy  the world s biggest  is expected to slow from a very robust 2018 but should remain strong until about mid 2020 when economists polled by Reuters expect it to settle at 1 8 percent  In October the International Monetary Fund cut its 2019 global growth forecast to 3 7 percent  citing the trade war  and in December Citi trimmed its prediction to 3 1 percent  What was hailed just a year ago as an era when the world s major economies would all grow together has evolved in a more volatile direction  with the United States juiced along by tax cuts and government spending while the rest of the world sputters  Businesses  amid uncertainty  have held back on the sort of investment that could boost long term growth  while governments globally struggle with a combination of high debt levels and mounting infrastructure needs  MARKET ALARMS  The U S  Federal Reserve s interest rate increases have caused investors to move in and out of various markets  hitting some emerging markets hard  It has also helped spark severe volatility in the U S  stock market and a months long selloff that analysts said signaled worries over a pending recession   Apple Inc  O AAPL  shares tumbled 9 96 percent on Thursday to their lowest level since mid 2017 after the company slashed its sales forecast   Apple s announcement triggered memories of a technology led market decline in 2000 that preceded a mild recession   It s oh so reminiscent   said David Rosenberg  an economist at Gluskin Sheff   Associates Inc  saying it was further evidence of a deteriorating outlook for Chinese manufacturing that will weigh on the global economy   On Thursday  one Fed official said further planned rate hikes should be halted until that large assortment of global issues gets resolved    I would be an advocate of taking no action   in the first couple of quarters this year   Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan told Bloomberg television  In December  Fed policymakers forecast a median of two more hikes this year  U S  ISOLATION  While Trump has put a March 1 deadline on striking a trade deal with Beijing  concerns extend beyond China to Europe  where a deal for Britain s exit from the European Union  known as Brexit  has not been agreed with less than three months to go before the March 29 deadline   But the impact of China is enormous  Chinese growth feeds into a variety of global prices such as oil  metals and microchips  driving investment and spending decisions worldwide  Evidence is piling up that tension between the world s two largest economies has dampened business confidence and depressed investment  It could mark a turn from most of 2018 when many economists and officials said the Trump administration s higher trade tariffs had yet to seriously hurt U S  growth  Kevin Hassett  the White House economic adviser  said on Thursday the sharp drop in Chinese economic growth will hit U S  profits but sales for Apple and other firms should rebound once a trade deal is struck   The U S  manufacturing sector has begun to slow  and the Institute of Supply Management s survey of corporate purchasing managers on Monday showed the largest monthly decline since the depths of the recession in December 2008  A Dallas Fed quarterly survey of energy firms showed a marked slowdown at the end of 2018   
 The rest of the world is slowing  especially Europe and China  but the U S  has enough momentum   said Mohamed El Erian  the chief economic adviser of asset manager and insurer Allianz  DE ALVG    The problem is policymakers are not sensitive enough to spill backs  and  market volatility could feed back into economic weakness  ",36.13,37.14,35.95,37.06,111448000,-1
01-04-2019,By Kevin Yao and Lusha Zhang BEIJING  Reuters    China s central bank said on Friday it was cutting the amount of cash that banks have to hold as reserves for the fifth time in a year  freeing up  116 billion for new lending as it tries to reduce the risk of a sharp economic slowdown  The move comes amid mounting worries about the health of the world s second largest economy  which is facing both slowing demand at home and punishing U S  tariffs on its exported goods  Global stock markets sold off on Thursday after a warning from tech giant Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL  about slowing China sales  while data earlier this week showed the country s manufacturing activity shrank in December for the first time in over two years   The announcement came just hours after Premier Li Keqiang said China would take further action to bolster the economy  including reserve requirement ratio  RRR  cuts and more cuts in taxes and fees  highlighting the urgency to cope with increased growth headwinds   This speedy RRR cut with great intensity fully demonstrates the determination of policymakers to stabilize growth   said Yang Hao  an analyst at Nanjing Securities   At present  the economy is facing very big downward pressure amid internal and external troubles   The cut in RRR is the first in 2019 by the People s Bank of China  PBOC   It cut the ratio for all banks  freeing up a net 800 billion yuan   116 51 billion  after lenders use some of the 1 5 trillion yuan in liquidity released to pay back maturing medium term loans  The size of the move was on the upper end of market expectations  and the net funds released would be the largest amount in the five cuts since last January   Policy easing will be stepped up further over coming months   Capital Economics said in a research note   With credit growth still slowing and  typically  a six month lag before any turnaround in credit affects the economy  worries about the outlook for China will persist for several months yet   RRRs   currently 14 5 percent for large institutions and 12 5 percent for smaller banks   will be lowered by a total of 100 basis points in two stages  the PBOC said  The cuts will be effective Jan  15 and Jan  25  ahead of the long Lunar New Year celebrations when cash conditions often get tight  MORE HELP COMING Further cuts in the RRR had been widely expected this year  especially after a spate of weak data in recent months showed China s economy was continuing to lose steam amid increased signs of a pinch from the trade war with the United States   The central bank said China s growth was still within a reasonable range and it would continue to implement a prudent monetary policy  without engaging in massive stimulus   We will maintain reasonable and sufficient liquidity  maintain reasonable growth in the scale of money and credit and social financing  stabilize macro leverage and seek internal and external balances   it said  Analysts say Beijing will have to keep up a relatively steady stream of stimulus to engineer a sustainable economic turnaround  But they note policy transmission difficulties faced by the central bank to boost credit for private and small firms   which are vital for economic growth and jobs  Cutting benchmark interest rates may be a last resort option as that could weigh on the yuan currency  and fuel debt risks in the economy  analysts say  Economists believe the government could take more fiscal steps by cutting taxes and boosting spending on infrastructure projects  amid expectations that the annual budget deficit ratio could be lifted to 3 percent in 2019 from 2 6 percent last year  Still  China s economic growth is expected to have cooled to around 6 5 percent last year   which would be the weakest since 1990   in line with Beijing s target but down from 6 9 percent in 2017  A further deceleration is seen this year  with some analysts forecasting growth will cool to just over 6 percent ,36.13,37.14,35.95,37.06,111448000,1
01-04-2019,"By Josh Horwitz and Stephen Nellis SHANGHAI SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  Inc s chief executive Tim Cook has his work cut out in China this year  the iPhone maker faces the looming threat of a court ordered sales ban  the uncertain outcome of trade war talks and the roll out of a new 5G network  where it finds itself behind rivals like Huawei and Samsung  The complex outlook raises a challenge for Apple as it looks to revive its China fortunes after weakness there sparked a rare drop in its global sales forecast  knocked  75 billion from its market valuation and roiled global markets  Cook told investors that the main drag on the firm s performance in China had been a sharper than expected slowdown in the country s economy  exacerbated by the impact of trade tensions between Washington and Beijing   We did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration  particularly in Greater China   he said  Chinese shoppers told Reuters another element had been key  the high price tag on Apple s flagship phones  Analysts said the firm faced a brewing storm of challenges  an economic slowdown  stronger rivals like Huawei Technologies Co Ltd  HWT UL  bringing out comparable tech at lower prices and bubbling patriotic sentiment amid the trade war  A Chinese court has also issued a preliminary injunction banning some Apple phones  part of a legal battle with chip maker Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  Inc  This ban  potentially hitting iPhone models from the 6S through the X  has yet to be enforced  On Thursday a local industry body  the China Anti Infringement and Anti Counterfeit Innovation Strategic Alliance  called on Apple to heed the court order and not  trample the Chinese law by leveraging its super economic power and clout   Apple declined to comment on the group s statement but has previously said it believes its current phones comply with the Chinese court s order    These are tough times for Apple in China   said Neil Shah  research director at Counterpoint  adding the iPhone could see its market share slip to 7 percent this year in the face of stronger local rivals and worry about the sales ban  Apple s market share in the third quarter of 2018 was around 9 percent  and has dipped from above 14 percent in 2015  overtaken by local rivals like Huawei  Oppo and Vivo  Apple vs Huawei   5G STRATEGY Another question mark for Apple is its 5G strategy in China  where the U S  firm is not expected to have a 5G enabled phone until 2020  behind rivals like Huawei  Xiaomi Corp and Samsung Electronics  KS 005930   China is looking to push ahead with its rollout of a faster 5G network  with a pre commercial phase this year and a commercial network in 2020  Some are looking to make an early bet on the technology  Huawei is planning a 5G phone mid year  while Xiaomi is aiming for the third quarter  Samsung is expected to unveil a 5G phone in the first half of the year  Industry insiders  however  said Apple would likely hold off until the fall of 2020 to have its own 5G enabled phone  a strategy that would bypass the untested early period of the technology  but which could mean Chinese shoppers delay iPhone purchases or buy another brand that switched to 5G earlier   I ll definitely be paying attention to 5G functionality when I buy my next phone   said Wu Chengjun  a graduate student in Beijing who currently uses an iPhone X  With the exception of Huawei  which makes it own 5G chips  Qualcomm is providing the technology to many of the major phone makers releasing 5G handsets this year   If you re a  phone maker  looking for a  super cycle   of sales   if you don t have 5G  your situation won t get any better   Cristiano Amon  Qualcomm s president  told Reuters in an interview   The carrier channel is going to be incentivized to start selling 5G phones in the second half  of 2019  he said  But there are risks integrating 5G too early into high end smart phones because the technology requires deeply re designing the devices with multiple new antennas  Given spotty coverage in 2019  gambling on a new design before networks are mature could be more risk than reward  said Darryn Lowe  a Bain   Co partner who works with the wireless industry   When you think about 5G  it s a heck of a lot more complicated than an aluminum strip running around the phone   he said   And other shoppers and analysts said Apple s more cautious approach to 5G made sense and that the firm would not likely lose out too much to rivals by delaying its launch  Apple s decision to wait to adopt 4G until after other makers didn t hurt it  But that was when consumers commonly purchased a phone every two years  a cycle that has elongated and might prompt buyers to want a more  future proof  device  said Glenn Lurie  CEO of Synchronoss Technologies and the former head of AT T s wireless unit   If you re going to walk in to make a 30 month decision  the concept that I ve already got 5G built in  it feels pretty good   Lurie said  But buyers such as Li Hongzhuo  22  a student in Beijing  said he was interested in 5G  but it wouldn t be the deciding factor and he preferred to wait until the technology was tried and tested   Typically my needs for my phone are high speeds for downloading videos or transferring files from chat apps  This will get faster  with 5G   but 4G already satisfies my needs   said Li  
 I won t really consider switching my phone until 5G has been operating stably on the market for some time without any bugs   or unless they stop offering 4G  ",36.13,37.14,35.95,37.06,111448000,1

been critical of him  Echoing a more sympathetic tone recently espoused by some of his colleagues  Powell said the Fed was  listening  to markets and would balance the steady flow of strong economic data against the array of risks   from slowing global growth to worries about the U S  China trade war   that have spooked investors   The message was heard on Wall Street  where major stock indexes surged about 3 5 percent to a more than two week high  The market bounce came after a volatile December selloff in which traders grew increasingly skeptical of the Fed s upbeat forecasts and plans to keep hiking interest rates in 2019    Particularly with the muted inflation readings that we ve seen coming in  we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves   Powell told the American Economic Association in Atlanta   The Fed  which hiked benchmark U S  interest rates four times last year including in December  is however not on a preset path and could pause policy tightening as it did in 2016 when global growth concerns led to doubts about the U S  economic recovery  he said   We are always prepared to shift the stance of policy and to shift it significantly  if needed  Powell said  speaking on a panel alongside former Fed chiefs Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke  That flexibility  he added  applied as well to the monthly reductions to the Fed s balance sheet  The Fed chief stressed that the economy remained on track and that the job market was quite strong  He did not address Fed forecasts from December that sketched out two more rate rises this year  but  combined with the messages of Fed presidents who in recent days downplayed that tightening plan  he delivered the sort of temperate message investors had hoped to hear    We really need to be looking at the data and having the economy tell us  do we need to move more  Do we need to move more  faster  Can we wait    Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank President Loretta Mester said in an interview with Reuters   We should take our time and assess     We may be where we need to be   Her comments  from a sometimes hawkish Fed official  highlighted the change in tone at a central bank that  after two years of roughly quarterly rate increases  was now assessing the risks of going too far  Following Powell s remarks  Treasury yields rose and futures traders began pricing in a small chance of a rate hike this year  versus no chance seen before Powell began speaking  Compared to comments he made after the Fed raised rates last month   it s not that he s changed his message     but that he explained it more patiently and in greater detail   said Lou Brien  market strategist at DRW Trading in Chicago  Powell s appearance in Atlanta was his first since last month s rate increase and a public lashing from Trump  who according to sources asked aides about his power to fire the Fed chairman  The head of the Fed  once confirmed by the Senate  can only be removed  for cause   not a policy disagreement  Powell responded with a terse  No  when asked if he would resign if Trump requested him to do so  SENSITIVE FED The recent market turbulence has posed a dilemma for the Fed  as a seeming loss of confidence in financial markets about the U S  economy s prospects was offset by upbeat data from the real economy  including a strong December jobs report   The Labor Department reported on Friday that 312 000 jobs were created last month  well above market expectations  Wages and labor force participation both rose  signaling sustained economic strength  Powell called the jobs report  very strong   with U S  data  on track to sustain good momentum into the new year   The world s biggest economy expanded well above potential last year and  along with U S  consumers  is expected to remain strong through this year  Yet signs are growing that Trump s tit for tat trade war with China is taking a toll  this week  tech giant Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and grains trader Cargill warned about weaker sales in China  Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said on Thursday that planned rate hikes should be halted for now  while on Friday Mester said she sees only one or two rate hikes this year  A third Fed president  Thomas Barkin of Richmond  said he is hearing more concerns about economic risks and trade   The markets are feeling better that the Fed is not strangling the overall economy and perhaps forcing it into a recession  and that removes a monetary policy concern that has been hanging over the market for the past few months   said Robert Pavlik  chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC   The Fed s tightening cycle includes both rate hikes and the gradual shedding of its more than  4 trillion in assets  Powell said he did not think the latter was having much impact on markets  but that the strategy would be changed if it started interfering with the bank s broader goals of maintaining strong employment and stable inflation   While not a change in policy  it was a nod to market concerns that the Fed had a key decision on  auto pilot   as Powell put it last month  even as it pledged to be dependent on economic data    The markets are pricing in downside risks     and they are obviously well ahead of the data  particularly if you look at this morning s labor market data   Powell said  
 I ll just say that we are listening carefully to that      listening sensitively to the message that markets are sending  and we are going to be taking those downside risks into account as we make policy going forward  ",36.13,37.14,35.95,37.06,111448000,1

China has moved quickly to meet  reasonable demands  from the U S  to help end the ongoing trade war but shouldn t dismantle its governance model as some in U S  President Donald Trump s administration want  former Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  China chairman Fred Hu said Monday 
Lower taxes on automobile imports and a new law banning forced technology transfers were sincere efforts by Beijing to resolve a U S  China trade conflict that has roiled markets for almost a year  Hu said at an annual conference on Greater China organized by UBS Group AG  Hu  founder of the investment firm Primavera Capital Group  is also on the board of UBS 
Trade officials from the two nations will meet in Beijing this week for the first face to face negotiations since the U S  President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed in December to a 90 day truce  The standoff has led to factories seeing orders slump in both countries  American farmers are hurting as is Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL    while Chinese markets ended 2018 with the world s worst stock rout 
While China has made taken some steps  it cannot and should not meet  aggressive and draconian  demands from some of the more hawkish Trump advisers such as dismantling the entire Chinese model of state led capitalism  according to Hu  He added that instances of forced technology transfer were  very rare  in his multi decade experience in advising overseas companies operating in the Asian country 
The Chinese style of state led development has proved effective in reducing poverty and building public infrastructure  said Hu   China has proven it can build infrastructure very quickly and there are merits to this model   he said  Meanwhile  the U S  government can be shut down over a wall

01-07-2019,"Continue to maintain exposure to both sides of the market if you are a shorter term trader  as the technical and sentiment signposts are not clear cut amid the volatility  Todd Salamone of Schaeffer s is presenting at MoneyShow Orlando 
 While bulls hope a bottom is in and a V rally is on the horizon  there are multiple resistance levels overhead that could be viewed as potential hesitation points if last week s rally continues    The first significant resistance area is at 2 507    the SPX s close the day of the Dec  19 Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  rate hike  The second resistance level is at 2 546    the close one day prior to the hike    suffice it to say that an area of strong potential resistance is between the 2 500 century mark and the 2 550 half century mark  
   Monday Morning Outlook  December 31  2018
Last Monday  after the S P 500 Index  SPX   2 531 94  and SPDR S P 500 ETF Trust  SPY  NYSE SPY    252 39  dodged weekly closes beneath their historically important 160 week moving averages and put up impressive post Christmas rallies  I concluded that the price action was encouraging but the bulls were not out of the woods 
Specifically  I pointed out that multiple technical resistance levels were overhead after a near 20  SPX decline that began in September  The first resistance level was around 2 507  the SPX s close the day of the Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  rate hike on Dec  19    and which we now know roughly coincided with 2018 s end of year close  lending even more significance to this level 
Since then  2019 has gotten off to a rough start  with the SPX selling off from its FOMC day and 2018 closing levels on Wednesday morning  only to reverse and close roughly flat on the day  But a weaker than forecast ISM manufacturing index reading  along with a weak forecast by Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   sent stocks sharply lower on Thursday  as investors fretted about slower growth related to  among other things  icy trade relations with China 
In fact  slowing growth has clearly been on the mind of investors  as the SPX lost more than 9  in the month of December  coincident with a sharp rise in the number of investors who expect the Fed to remain on hold or lower interest rates in 2019    even as the Fed communicated on Dec  19 that it expects to hike rates two times this year 
A chart of CME Group  NASDAQ CME  data that appeared in The Wall Street Journal on Jan  4 gives you a flavor for how much investors soured on growth prospects for 2019 in the month of December  The proportion of investors expecting the Fed not to raise rates further in 2019 jumped significantly last month  from around 30  to near 100   even as the FOMC was projecting two more rate hikes for this year as of mid December  The poor ISM reading stoked fears that the Fed is gearing up to make a huge mistake in 2019 
 With the muted inflation readings that we ve seen  we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves    We will be prepared to adjust policy quickly and flexibly and to use all of our tools to support the economy should that be appropriate to keep the expansion on track    there is no pre set path for policy    If we came to the view that the balance sheet normalization or any other aspect of normalization was part of the problem  we wouldn t hesitate to make a change  
   Fed Chairman Jerome Powell  January 4  2019
Friday was a different day with new information for investors to consume    and bulls can be thankful for this  First  stocks rallied strongly as nonfarm payrolls increased by 312 000  soaring above expectations that ranged from an increase of 175 000 190 000  Earnings growth also surpassed expectations  and data dependent  in the moment traders bid stocks higher  adding to bullish momentum fueled by news that China had cut its reserve requirement ratio  as slowing China growth has weighed on growth prospects here 
As if the China and payrolls news was not enough to feed a buying frenzy  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell  speaking in Atlanta  further soothed investors  who perceived his comments as more dovish than in mid December  Said another way  whereas investors perceived that there was not an outstanding  Powell put  in December  Friday s remarks gave investors an impression that there is indeed a Powell put  a perception that is needed during times of uncertainty and heightened volatility 
Friday s rally was enough to push the SPX above its 2018 close of 2 506 85  which roughly coincides with its closing level from Dec  19  when the FOMC last hiked rates  However  the rally was not enough to push the SPX above 2 546  its close on the eve of the rate hike  which is situated around the round 2 550 half century mark 
Moreover  the early 2018 lows around 2 580 that  when breached in December  saw the proverbial bottom fall out  represent yet another resistance level that must be taken out before a V bottom can be taken seriously or considered sustainable  Plus  those early 2018 lows are situated a round 10  above the December closing low    which is another reason 2 580 takes on importance from a short term perspective  as a profit taking mentality is likely to surface among short term traders 




 The SPX s half century 2 350 level marked last week s low and is therefore a potential    if not critical    support level for bulls if a pullback is on the immediate horizon  
   Monday Morning Outlook  December 31  2018
From a longer term perspective  the SPX 2 350 level remains important if the advance proves short lived  But if you are looking for another area of potential support in the short term  the round 2 500 level on the SPX is just under 2018 s year end close and the Dec  19 close  and thus offers a potential level of support 
I am finding the action in the CBOE Volatility Index  VIX   21 38  interesting in these last two weeks  The Christmas Eve closing high was 36 07  just 1 point below the 52 week closing high of 37 32 in February  The VIX has imploded since Christmas Eve by about 40   Bulls would like to see the VIX get below 18 30  which is double the 2018 closing low and roughly half last month s intraday high 
Also  18 36 is the site of the VIX s 100 day moving average  which was supportive on a pullback in March and acted as resistance from May September  The crossover in October was indicative of higher volatility ahead  and a VIX pullback in early December saw the lows at this moving aver",37.17,37.21,36.47,36.98,109012000,1
01-07-2019,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Monday  Jan  7 
1  U S   China Trade Talks Kick Off
Two days of trade talks between the U S  and China got underway in Beijing on Monday  with investors hoping the two sides can strike a comprehensive trade deal before the end of a 90 day truce in the trade war 
Washington and Beijing have until March 1 to make a deal  after which U S  President Donald Trump has pledged to ramp up tariffs to 25   from 10   on  200 billion worth of Chinese imports 
The prolonged trade spat between the world s two largest economies has given rise to fears over an economic slowdown in China following a recent string of weak economic data and fueled concerns over the impact on the broader global economy after Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  issued a revenue warning last week 
2  Relief Rally in Equities Fades
U S  stock index futures pointed to a flat to lower open on Wall Street as a relief rally in global equities markets lost momentum 
At 5 40 AM ET  10 40 GMT   the blue chip Dow futures were flat  S P 500 futures dipped 0 09   while the Nasdaq 100 futures traded down 0 23  
In Europe  stock markets slipped into the red  giving up gains after a higher open 
Risk appetite was sapped with U S  lawmakers still unable to reach an agreement to end a government shutdown  while risks from Brexit continued to cloud the outlook in Europe 
Overnight  Chinese stocks firmed after the country s central bank announced an easing in policy aimed at addressing an economic slowdown  while the resumption of trade talks between Washington and Beijing had also buoyed risk appetite  sending Asian markets broadly higher 
U S  markets had rebounded Friday after a stronger than expected U S  jobs report and following comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell  who indicated the central bank would be patient and flexible on monetary policy this year 
3  Oil Prices Jump around 3 
Oil prices jumped higher on hopes that easing trade tensions between the U S  and China would boost the demand outlook  while supply cuts by major producers also supported crude 
Global benchmark Brent crude futures were last at  58 75 per barrel  up  1 68  or 3  from their last close 
U S  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude oil futures were at  49 37 per barrel  up  1 41 or 2 96  
Despite the likelihood of an economic slowdown as a result of the trade war crude prices were being supported by supply cuts started late last year by a group of producers around the Middle East dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  as well as non OPEC Russia 
Goldman Sachs said the cuts would result in a gradual increase in spot crude prices in 2019 as high inventories revert to their 5 year averages 
4  Dollar Loses Ground
The greenback was broadly lower against the other major currencies  with the U S  dollar index  which measures the greenback s strength against a basket of six major currencies  down 0 3  to 95 46 
The U S  dollar remained on the back foot following Friday s Fed comments  while the resumption of U S  China trade talks undermined safe haven demand for the buck 
The euro was stronger  with EUR USD up 0 41  to 1 1437 even after data showing that German factory orders fell more than expected in November  Separate reports showed that euro zone investor moral fell to a four year low in January  but retail sales in the bloc rose strongly in November

5  ISM Non Manufacturing PMI
On the data front  ISM non manufacturing figures for December are due to be released at 10 00 AM ET and are expected to show a modest decline  but the risk is that they turn in a downside surprise like last week s ISM manufacturing index 
The ISM non manufacturing PMI is expected to tick down to 59 6 from November s 60 7 
Data last Thursday showed that U S  factory activity slowed sharply to a two year low in December  suggesting the economy is probably not immune to slowing growth in China and Europe  despite the labor market remaining strong

Investors  speculators and other market participants who were away during the holidays are slowly returning to the markets  Those that made it back in the first week of 2019 had to hit the ground running  Stocks initially tumbled on the back of a revenue warning from Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and as fears about the health of the Chinese economy grew  before Wall Street staged one of the best one day gains in seven years on Friday 
Friday s gains came on the back of strong jobs and wages data from the U S  economy  which alleviated growth concerns about the wold s largest economy  What s more  Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell delivered some reassurance on interest rates as he said the Fed will not rush to tighten further and that reductions in the central bank s balance sheet was not necessarily on  autopilot   walking back his previous hawkish comments 
Stocks were supported further after China announced fresh measures to boost lending in order to halt a slowdown in the world s second largest economy  Meanwhile there were signs of progress on the U S China trade dispute after Beijing confirmed that it would hold trade talks with the United States next week 
In the FX space  the U S  dollar fell on Friday despite a 312 000 gain in December non farm payrolls and a better than expected 0 4  rise in average hourly earnings  as Powell s dovish remarks gave the dollar bears the perfect excuse to exert pressure on the buck after its post NFP bounce 
Stocks not out of the woods  pressure growing on the dollar
As we start the first full trading week of 2019 now  the U S  dollar is finding itself under pressure and stock indices are giving back some of the sharp gains made on Friday  It is not clear at this stage whether it is  risk off  environment again  as some profit taking should have been expected after Friday s big rally in what essentially is a bearish trend for stocks  Things should become clearer in a few days  time as the major U S  indices test key technical levels  with the S P 500  for example  deciding whether to hold below or break back above the February 2018 low around 2532  see chart

US CPI and BOC among fundamental highlights this week
In terms of this week  don t expect too much reaction from the minutes of the FOMC s December policy meeting  which will be released on Wednesday  At that meeting  the Fed decided to raise interest rates for the fourth time in 2018 despite pressure from President Trump  and signalled just two rate increases in 2019  However  the minutes will be dated as we have already heard from the Fed Chair on Friday  when he walked back his remarks on the Fed s balance sheet reduction being on autopilot  Powell is expected to speak again on Thursday at The Economic Club of Washington DC 
As far as this week s scheduled economic data is concerned  we will have the ISM services PMI later today but the key U S  data will probably be Friday s publication of consumer price inflation  CPI   Investors will be watching for signs that inflation is slowing down as they try to determine the Fed s next move on monetary policy 
On Friday we will also have UK GDP and manufacturing production data  although the markets are unlikely to react too much on this as the focus will be firmly fixated on Brexit  Meanwhile  the Bank of Canada s rate decision is on Wednesday  Previously  the BOC was expected to hike rates to 2 0  at this meeting  but now the market expects the central bank to keep rates unchanged at 1 75  after a strong hint from the bank s Governor at the end of last year ",37.39,37.96,37.13,37.69,216071600,1
01-08-2019,"By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK  Reuters    Investors are growing more fearful that U S  companies  profits could shrink this year following Apple s warning of soft demand in China  coupled with mounting evidence of a drag from tariffs  a global slowdown and fading tailwinds from tax cuts  Profit growth estimates for 2019 had already been eroding for months before widely held Apple Inc  O AAPL  darkened the outlook further last week with the first cut to its sales forecast in more than 15 years  Earnings this year were never going to rise as quickly as in 2018  when federal tax cuts fueled growth rates above 20 percent for S P 500  SPX  companies for much of the year  according to Refinitiv s IBES  For 2019  analysts now see profits growing by 6 8 percent  down sharply from an Oct  1 estimate of 10 2 percent earnings growth  Moreover  in the first half of 2019  profits are seen rising substantially more slowly than that pace  thanks largely to the rapid decline in forecasts for technology sector earnings  which should account for roughly a fifth of the index s profits  That has some investors watching for signs that U S  stocks could slip into a profits recession  defined as at least two straight quarters of year over year earnings declines  The last of those occurred from July 2015 through June of 2016  which dovetailed with a broad run of stock market underperformance   You bet it s on the radar   said Hugh Johnson  chief investment officer of Hugh Johnson Advisors LLC in Albany  New York   The Apple comments and where they re headed   that s going to cause estimates to come down even further   APPLE WARNING  GOES TO THE HEART  Increased concern over the potential for an earnings recession comes at a turbulent time for stocks  with the S P 500 registering its worst December performance since the Great Depression  only to rally more than 9 percent since hitting a 20 month low on Christmas Eve  With the S P 500 recently trading at 14 times expected earnings  down from a multiple of 18 a year ago  a key argument for market bulls is that stocks have become undervalued after the recent sell off  Apple s news also highlights the potential impact of trade tensions between the two largest economies  the United States and China  The warning from Apple  started to provide kind of a confirmation for the earnings recession folks out there   said Chuck Carlson  chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond  Indiana   Its impact goes beyond just its suppliers  it goes to the heart of investment psyche for a lot of folks   he said   Profit forecasts for technology companies have fallen more than for any sector other than energy  which has been buffeted by the collapse in oil prices   S P 500 tech  SPLRCT  earnings are expected to decline year over year for the first three quarters of 2019  based on Refinitiv s data  and deliver growth of just 2 6 percent this year  the lowest of any sector   That is a big reversal from its long standing role as a profit growth leader  Tech  in the top three sectors ranked by profit growth in seven of the last eight quarters  is estimated to have delivered earnings per share growth of 23 2 percent in 2018  To be sure  there are plenty of strategists who still say an earnings recession this year is unlikely  thanks to a relatively still solid U S  economy  Friday s jobs report helped support that view   Earnings recessions are exceptionally rare outside of an economic recession   said Hans Olsen  chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company in Boston   I don t think we are going to have another earnings recession  but it might feel like a recession   PROFIT RECESSION VS ECONOMIC RECESSION Since 1968  as far back as Refinitiv s data goes  the S P 500 has had 10 earnings recessions  the longest spanning from the third quarter of 2007 to the third quarter of 2009  That roughly coincided with a financial crisis and the worst economic recession since the Great Depression  While the last S P 500 earnings recession occurred without an economic recession  that was an exception  Seven of the 10 profit recessions since 1968 have coincided with a formal economic recession   GRAPHIC  U S  quarterly profit growth since 1968      Financials  health care and other sectors could pick up some of the slack as tech earnings falter  some strategists say  This year s estimates for those sectors have held up better than others  Refinitiv s numbers show   Adding to U S  companies  potential woes  a strengthening dollar could become an even bigger negative for many U S  multinationals this year  strategists said   The dollar index  DXY   which tracks the greenback against six major currencies  rose 1 percent during the fourth quarter and was up 4 4 percent year over year by the end of the quarter   People are just starting to talk about  dollar strength    Fiduciary Trust s Olsen said  Weaker oil prices will drag as well  he said  in a reversal of what occurred in 2018  Top strategists at some big banks had been getting more pessimistic on earnings heading into the new year   Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  in its outlook late last year said there was more than a 50 percent chance of a  modest earnings recession  in 2019

01-08-2019,"Some economists think the U S  economy may have hit peak growth  which is bullish for the euro reports Fawad Razaqzada 
Although slightly lower today  the EUR USD has been holding its own rather well despite continued weakness in Eurozone data  In part  the exchange rates resilience has been due to ongoing weakness in the dollar rather than euro strength as investors have been lowering their expectations over further interest rate increases in the United States  while Eurozone interest rate expectations haven t moved much recently  While we are unsure about the longer term direction of the EUR USD  we think there is a possibility that the exchange rate could appreciate further in the short term outlook 
The recent sell off in the stock markets underscore concerns over economic growth  as do the disappointing sales forecasts from Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and now Samsung  KS 005930  for their smartphones  Demand has been hit by the recent currency crisis in several emerging market economies  the impact of higher U S  tariffs on Chinese exports and tighter monetary conditions in the United States  among other factors 
Although employment growth is still strong and wages have picked up  some economists think the U S  economy may have hit peak growth as the impact of the past tax cuts start to fade away  The Federal Reserve has indicated it wants to pause hiking and assess the economic situation before deciding whether to tighten its belt further  Meanwhile  the European Central Bank continues to expect lifting interest rates after the summer  should economic conditions still warrant it 
Also painting a moderately bullish picture for the EUR USD is the fact that the German US 10 year bond yield spread has widened in favor of Germany  see chart below   Yield seeking investors are finding European assets marginally more valuable than U S  assets  underpinning demand for the single currency  In fact  the yield spread has created a divergence as it has made a higher high  while the EUR USD hasn t created a corresponding higher high yet  This is a major warning sign for the EUR USD bears as it indicates the exchange rate may have catching up to do  Note that the previous divergences saw the EUR USD eventually go in the direction of the yield spread  What makes this particular divergence even more interesting is the fact that the EUR USD has held its own above long term support around the 1 13 handle and created a couple of interesting price candles on its monthly chart

So  the potential is there for a breakout on the EUR USD despite all the doom and gloom out there  But overall  price action on this pair is still  understandably  choppy and range bound  Conservative traders may therefore wish to wait for more signals to emerge before taking a directional view on the EUR USD  Friday s US CPI and next Tuesday s Brexit vote in the UK parliament are among the most important short term catalysts for this pair ",37.39,37.96,37.13,37.69,216071600,1
01-08-2019,"Undoubtedly  most investors were hoping that the first rally of the New Year was going to stick around for more than just a few days  The jury is still out whether or not the market is going to continue its bearish trend  writes Jay Soloff Tuesday  He s presenting at MoneyShow Orlando Feb  7 8 
But  the surprising news from Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  certainly casts a shadow over the brief glimmer of hope from investors 
In case you missed it  AAPL preannounced poor earnings based on slower than expected sales   primarily in China  The company lowered revenue guidance for the first time in 12 years and it sent a ripple through the markets  If one of the largest companies in the world is struggling  what s that mean for everyone else 
It does seem to show that the trade tariff war between the U S  and China is having real consequences on American companies  AAPL shares dropped 10  on the day after the announcement  with the S P 500 pulling back 2 5   Once again  that s not the day bulls were hoping for after several up days in a row 
Given all the uncertainty in the market these days  it s important for investors to understand the value of hedging  That is  every investor who owns stocks should know how to protect against downside risk  This includes those holding single stocks  ETFs  index funds and other mutual funds 
Essentially  downside risk can be hedged with any asset that makes money as the market goes down  It s a way to counter the losses you may incur from your long stock fund positions  The easiest way to do this is with inverse ETFs and options 
Both inverse ETFs and options  long puts  are easy enough to implement as hedges  I m going to focus on options in this article 
In most cases  simply buying a put option on the asset you want protected is all you need to do  A put option will only cost a fraction of the cost of the stock  so even if you lose money on the put  which is preferable  you won t sacrifice your upside return all that much  in most cases   And since options use leverage  if your put pays off  it can cover most or all of your losses on the asset on a down move 
It s easier to look at a hedge through an example  So  here s an actual hedge trade against real estate stocks that recently hit the tape  By the way  that s the beauty of an options hedge  You can pick the time frame you want  while protecting against any sort of asset class   as long as it has an ETF available  which is pretty much all of them  
The trade I m referring to occurred in iShares US Real Estate ETF  IYR   With IYR at  74  the trader purchased the January 11th 71 5 put for  0 32  This is essentially a one week hedge that protects against the real estate ETF falling below  71  technically  71 18 is the breakeven point  
The trader bought about 7 000 of these puts for roughly  220 000 in premium  which is also the max loss on the trade  However  if the market sells off sharply over the next week and takes real estate stocks down with it  the hedge will really pay off 
As a matter of fact  for every  1 below the breakeven point  the hedge will generate about  700 000  If you re concerned about a short term drop in real estate stock prices  this is a really good method of protecting your portfolio  Paying just  0 32 per option is a reasonable price to pay for downside protection for a week  especially given how volatile the market has been the last several months

01-08-2019," Bloomberg     Chinese authorities planned to give a statement following the latest round of U S  trade talks on Tuesday in Beijing  after both sides signaled progress toward resolving a conflict that has roiled markets 
 The talks are still underway and I believe we will release a detailed readout after they are concluded   Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told reporters at a regular briefing Tuesday in Beijing  No timing was given and it wasn t immediately clear if the U S  would release a statement 
U S  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross expressed optimism on Monday  telling CNBC that  there s a very good chance that we ll get a reasonable settlement   Vice Premier Liu He made an appearance at the talks on Monday in a sign the Chinese were also pushing for a positive outcome 
Liu  the chief economic adviser to Chinese President Xi Jinping  made brief remarks at the negotiations  a person familiar with the meeting said  Asked about his presence on Tuesday  Lu from the foreign ministry said it wasn t surprising for Liu to be there  Liu led a previous round of talks in Washington last year that ended in failure  and he s expected to meet chief U S  negotiator Robert Lighthizer later this month 
Since the two presidents met on Dec  1  China has made a number of concessions to U S  demands  including temporarily cutting punitive tariffs on U S  made cars  resuming soybean purchases  promising to open up its markets for more foreign investment  and drafting a law to prevent forced technology transfers 
How China will enforce those measures will be key to any deal  U S  officials have repeatedly accused China of not fulfilling agreements  with Ross saying on Monday that  the real issue is what are the enforcement mechanisms  what are the punishments if people don t do what they were supposed to do  
The U S  negotiators in Beijing are pushing the Chinese side to come up with a mechanism to ensure that Beijing keeps the promises it makes  the Wall Street Journal reported  That includes giving specific dates for making purchases  and making assurances that Beijing won t hinder U S  companies from gaining access to China s market 
Economic Cost
Six months after President Donald Trump first slapped tariffs on Chinese goods  signs are growing that the trade war is exacting an economic and financial cost  increasing the incentive for both sides to end the conflict  Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL   cut its revenue outlook last week as sales of the iPhone were slower than expected in China  while data on factory activity and retail sales in the Asian nation were also weak 
Liu s appearance at the talks is a  symbol of Xi s personal buy in  in the effort to reach a deal  said Leland Miller  chief executive officer of China Beige Book  a data analytics firm that surveys companies across the Chinese economy   Beijing wants to show this is supported at the very highest level  
But much work remains before the two economic powers climb down  Trump has given U S  Trade Representative Lighthizer until March 1 to negotiate an accord with the Chinese on  structural changes  to Beijing s state driven economic model  The two sides have shown signs of common ground in the past year  only for progress to stall 
The discussions are the first face to face interactions between the U S  and China since both presidents met in Argentina and agreed to a temporary truce in their tit for tat tariff war  More senior level discussions could take place this month  with the South China Morning Post reporting that Trump and Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan may meet at the World Economic Forum in Davos  Switzerland 
China s foreign ministry on Monday confirmed that Wang would deliver a keynote speech at Davos  though didn t confirm any plans for him to meet Trump

01-10-2019,"Investing com    Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated his statement that the FOMC would be patient on monetary policy Thursday  but he hit equity markets after raising worries again that quantitative tightening of the Fed s balance sheet would be on autopilot 
The S P 500 was flat in afternoon trading  but sentiment on equities turned sour somewhat as Powell said the Fed s balance sheet will be  substantially smaller   indicating the central bank will press ahead with its balance sheet wind down operation  which peaked at roughly  4 5 trillion in Jan  2015  but has now narrowed to about  4 trillion 
The Fed chief did not give a timeline for winding down the balance sheet 
On interest rates  Powell said the central bank will be  patient   as it weighs the pace of global growth and domestic inflation  reaffirming investor expectations for a slower pace on monetary policy tightening 
Powell s cautious tone served as another sign that the Fed is no hurry to hike up rates and comes just a day after the release of the central bank s December meeting minutes  in which policymakers cited waning inflation  worsening financial conditions and slowing global growth as reason to  be patient about further policy firming 
Powell also touched on the growing disparity between good momentum in economic data and concerns in financial markets over risks  stressing the underlying economy remained robust 
 Especially with inflation low and under control we have the ability to be patient and watch patiently and carefully as we     figure out which of these two narratives is going to be the story of 2019   he said 
Powell downplayed the short term impact of the ongoing U S  government shutdown  which entered its third week Monday  but said an extended shutdown would lead to a less clear picture of the economy on which to base monetary policy decisions 
In the midst of the ongoing trade spat between the US and China  the Fed chairman said Apple s  NASDAQ AAPL  iPhone sales warning shows growth is slowing in China  though he still expected the Chinese economy to generate  solid growth  this year 
Powell also expressed concern about the bulging amount of U S  debt  which stands at about  21 9 trillion  saying he was  worried about it

01-10-2019," Bloomberg     Xiaomi Corp  s billionaire co founder  shrugging off a share slump that wiped  6 billion off its market value in just three days  expects the advent of next generation wireless to energize demand for its smartphones 
The Chinese devices maker is now focusing on pushing upmarket while expanding into Europe  forgoing the U S   Chief Executive Officer Lei Jun told Bloomberg Television  He didn t outline his reasons for avoiding the world s largest economy  once deemed a promising arena for Xiaomi but now increasingly hostile to Chinese corporations 
On Thursday  Xiaomi announced plans to give its bargain  Redmi  label more prominence so it can begin to raise prices and specs on its flagship Mi gadgets  That effort to elevate its name comes as the smartphone boom plateaus and China s economy decelerates  But rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co  have already claimed a share of the higher end of the market  encroaching on Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL   s turf 
While Lei declined to comment on how an economic deceleration might affect his business  he did say 5G will revive not just demand for smartphones  but also the internet services Xiaomi hosts  They now run the gamut from online music to movies and serve  collectively  some 220 million users 
 In China  the penetration rate of smartphones is extremely high   Lei said in an interview   But I think we are at the eve of 5G  I believe when 5G phones start to get popular  the overall demand from China will recover  
Xiaomi shares rose 2 1 percent to HK 10 18 as of 11 21 a m  in Hong Kong  The stock is 40 percent below the price in July s initial public offering and shed 17 percent in the past three days after a post IPO lockup on billions of shares was lifted  Several analysts cut their price targets or estimates on the former high flier this week  Once touted as an internet company that can command a value of as much as  100 billion  Xiaomi is now worth roughly a third of that 
In the wake of Apple s shock outlook cut last week  CLSA slashed its forecast on Xiaomi s shipments by 15 percent to 135 million units this year    lagging Huawei but ahead of local rivals including like Oppo 
To be sure  it s come a long way since its inception  Shareholders who ve owned a piece of the company since its first funding rounds can pocket a fat profit  Some 3 9 billion shares bought in a round of funding that started in 2010 cost less than two Hong Kong cents each  according to the company s prospectus 
 Over the past two to three years  we have entered about 80 countries and regions   Lei told reporters at an earlier roundtable   I hope the momentum continues

and China passenger car sales  the company expects 2018 profit to exceed Wall Street expectations  and promised higher earnings per share in 2019  Chief Executive Mary Barra  in her presentation to investors on Friday  stood her ground on cost cutting actions that have provoked threats of retribution from U S  President Donald Trump and outrage from unions and elected officials in the affected states   Because of the actions we have been taking for several years  General Motors enters 2019 leaner  more agile and positioned to win   Barra told investors at the New York presentation   The

01-11-2019,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Friday  Jan  11 
1  U S  inflation will be center of attention
Retail inflation numbers will be the focus of Friday s economic calendar as the Labor Department releases the December consumer price index  CPI  report at 8 30 AM ET  13 30 GMT  
On average  economists expect that the CPI fell 0 1  last month  But the core CPI  which excludes volatile food and energy prices  is forecast to have risen 0 2  in December 
On an annual basis the core CPI is expected to post a rise of 2 2   slightly above the Federal Reserve s 2  target 
Fed speakers  especially chief Jerome Powell  have held more sway on the markets than economic indicators of late  But it s important to note that the Fed s  patience  will also make policymakers more data dependent 
2  U S  Dollar Drops as Powell Repeats Promise for Patience
The U S  dollar pressed lower against major rivals on Friday as Powell reiterated a day earlier that the Fed would be patient and flexible on monetary policy 
Powell s cautious tone served as another sign that the Fed is no hurry to hike rates  following a string of policymakers who indicated that they will wait to tighten policy further until they have a better handle on whether slowing global growth and financial market volatility will negatively impact the U S  economy 
 Especially with inflation low and under control we have the ability to be patient and watch patiently and carefully as we     figure out which of these two narratives is going to be the story of 2019   Powell said on Thursday 
3  U S  stocks may snap 5 day winning streak amid recession worries
U S  futures pointed to a flat open on Friday but slight losses in the S P threatened to put an end to the S P 500 s five day rally  its longest since September  as odds of a recession in the U S  hit a six year high  At 5 57 AM ET  10 57 GMT   the blue chip Dow futures inched up 2 points  or 0 01   S P 500 futures lost 2 points  or 0 08   while the Nasdaq 100 futures traded down 11 points  or 0 16  
Indications that the Fed will take a pause in its recent gradual policy tightening and an optimistic outlook for trade negotiations between the U S  and China after a round of talks this week has put the global benchmark on track for a weekly rise of 2 5 
But concerns over the potential impact of the U S  partial government shutdown  weak holiday sales from Macy s  NYSE M  and a global economic slowdown that has begun to impact revenue from Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  to American Airlines  NASDAQ AAL  gave investors a reason to become cautious ahead of the U S  earnings season which is set to kick off next week with results from JP Morgan  NYSE JPM  
The gloomy outlook caused economists to increase the odds for a recession in the U S  in the next 12 months  Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg over the past week see a median 25  chance of a slump in the next year  up from 20  in the December survey 
4  Federal workers to miss first paycheck amid emergency shutdown
The partial government shutdown entered its 21st day on Friday in what will be the first day that the political impasse officially hits the pocketbooks of Federal workers 
Paychecks  scheduled for release Friday under normal circumstances  are on hold for some 800 000 federal employees that were forced to go on unpaid leave or work without pay since Dec  22 because of the government shutdown  Most of those workers were paid on Dec  28 in the final two week pay period of 2018 
Powell downplayed the short term impact of the ongoing U S  government shutdown in his remarks on Thursday  but said an extended shutdown would lead to a less clear picture of the economy on which to base monetary policy decisions

The stunning comeback rally that took crude futures by storm since Christmas appears to be stalling as multiple data points suggest that China s economy    the world s second largest and the bulwark of global growth    is slowing 
New York traded  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude settled down  1 08  or 2 1   at  50 51 per barrel as stocks on Wall Street slipped after an unexpected drop in China s exports in December 
London traded Brent crude  the global oil benchmark  slid by  1 43  or 2 4   to  59 05 by 2 46 PM ET  19 46 GMT 

China s December exports fell by 4 4 percent from last year  the biggest drop in 2 years  Chinese imports also plunged by 7 6 percent  the biggest drop since 2016  The data reinforced concerns that U S  tariffs were taking a toll on Chinese goods  prompting even U S  tech giant Apple Inc  O NASDAQ AAPL   which manufactures out of China  to issue a profit warning 
 On the crude oil front  the news from China took this market out of the green as well   Dan Flynn  analyst at The Price Futures Group in Chicago wrote in his Monday note  as WTI and Brent became correlated with the stock market again after a near uninterrupted three week rally 
While oil has rallied with little resistance so far this year  the enigma to many is how much further the current bull market can go without flipping as Saudi determination to cut supply faces China s vulnerable economy and its drag on global energy demand 
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih said last week the Kingdom was pumping approximately 800 000 barrels less a day from a record high of 10 2 million barrels per day in November  The amount Riyadh would ship overseas in February would be another 100 000 bpd less than January s 7 2 million bpd  he added 
While WTI settled last week with its biggest weekly gain in at least six months   up almost 8 percent   Friday s market itself was down as investors took profit after concerns that the latest U S  Sino trade talks ended without a positive outcome 
Even if a trade deal is struck  there are worries that China s 2019 growth could be one of the lowest since 1990  Being the world s biggest oil consumer  any significant slide in China s economy will have major ramifications for energy demand 
WTI has gained about 20 percent since hitting 18 month lows of  42 36 on Christmas Eve  There are expectations that it could test  55 per barrel as part of oil bulls  aim to get to  60 within the first quarter  At  60 per barrel  that would be a 42 percent rebound from 2018 lows  more than last year s tumble  But in dollar terms  the recovery per barrel would only be about  17 compared to the  37 lost from 2018 highs ",37.71,37.82,37.31,37.5,129756800,-1

01-14-2019,"By Yawen Chen and Martin Quin Pollard BEIJING  Reuters    China s exports unexpectedly fell the most in two years in December  while imports also contracted  pointing to further weakness in the world s second largest economy in 2019 and deteriorating global demand  Adding to policymakers  worries  data on Monday also showed China posted its biggest trade surplus with the United States on record in 2018  which could prompt President Donald Trump to turn up the heat on Beijing in their bitter trade dispute  Softening demand in China is being felt around the world  with slowing sales of goods from iPhones to automobiles  prompting warnings from the likes of Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and from Jaguar Land Rover  which last week announced sweeping job cuts   The dismal December trade readings suggest China s economy may have cooled faster than expected late in the year  despite a slew of growth boosting measures in recent months ranging from higher infrastructure spending to tax cuts  Some analysts had already speculated that Beijing may have to speed up and intensify its policy easing and stimulus measures this year after factory activity shrank in December  China s December exports unexpectedly fell 4 4 percent from a year earlier  with demand in most of its major markets weakening  Imports also saw a shock drop  falling 7 6 percent in their biggest decline since July 2016  Analysts had expected export growth to slow to 3 percent with imports up 5 percent   Today s data reflect an end to export front loading and the start of payback effects  while the global slowdown could also weigh on China s exports   Nomura economists wrote in a note  referring to a surge in shipments to the U S  over much of last year as companies rushed to beat further tariffs   The export growth print also suggests that the recent strength of the yuan might be short lived  Beijing will perhaps be more eager to strike a trade deal with the U S   and that policymakers will need to take more aggressive measures to stabilize GDP growth   Net exports had already been a drag on China s economic growth in the first three quarters of last year  after giving it a boost in 2017  Asian shares and U S  stock market futures fell as the surprisingly weak Chinese data added to fears of weaker corporate profits and investment  while the yuan currency gave up some of its early gains  MKTS GLOB  HIGHER TRADE SURPLUS WITH U S  China s politically sensitive surplus with the U S  widened by 17 2 percent to  323 32 billion last year  the highest on record going back to 2006  according to Reuters calculations based on customs data  China s large trade surplus with the United States has long been a sore point with Washington  which has demanded Beijing take steps to sharply reduce it  Washington imposed import tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese goods last year and has threatened further action if Beijing does not change its practices on issues ranging from industrial subsidies to intellectual property  China has retaliated with tariffs of its own   However  Beijing s export data had been surprisingly resilient to tariffs for much of 2018  possibly because companies ramped up shipments before broader and stiffer U S  duties went into effect   As many market watchers predicted  that boost has faded in the last few months  China exports to the U S  declined 3 5 percent in December while its imports from the U S  were down 35 8 percent for the month  China s total global exports rose 9 9 percent in 2018  its strongest performance in seven years  while imports increased 15 8 percent  But December s gloomy data  along with several months of falling factory orders  suggest a further weakening in its exports in the near term   A trade recession is likely  in our view   Raymond Yeung  chief economist at ANZ  said in a note  predicting a period of export contraction similar to 2015 16   The global electronics cycle remains the key driver of Chinese exports  A potential downturn in the sector poses the real risk to China s external outlook even if China and the U S  reach a resolution on their trade dispute   ING said a fall in electronic shipments could be related to foreign companies avoiding using China made electronic components  adding that exports and imports of electronic parts and goods will likely shrink this year   WEAK IMPORTS HIGHLIGHT SOFTENING DEMAND The higher tariffs China levied on U S  supplies also hit overall import growth  For all of 2018  soybeans  the second largest imports from the U S   fell for the first time since 2011  Even if Washington and Beijing reach a trade deal in their current round of talks  it would be no panacea for China s slowing economy  analysts say   The import slowdown is consistent with other signs that growth in China s domestic economy continued to weaken   said Louis Kuijs  head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics   Overall economic growth slowed further in the fourth quarter and remains under pressure from weaker exports  slow credit growth and cooling real estate activity   Chinese policymakers are widely expected to roll out more support measures in coming months if domestic and external conditions continue to deteriorate  Early this month  the central bank said it would slash banks  reserve requirements    the fifth such cut in a year    as it tries to encourage more lending and reduce the risk of a sharp slowdown   If pressure on the economy is still relatively large in the first half  a cut every quarter should be highly likely   said Xu Gao  chief economist at Everbright Securities   In an annual meeting of top leaders last month  China said it will boost support for the economy in 2019 by cutting taxes and stepping up policy adjustments  A few analysts believe interest rate cuts are a possibility  but most expect Beijing will refrain from massive stimulus measures like those deployed in the past  due to worries that it could add to a mountain of debt and weaken the yuan   
Sources told Reuters last week that Beijing is planning to lower its economic growth target to 6 6 5 percent this year after an expected 6 6 percent in 2018  the slowest pace in 28 years ",37.71,37.82,37.31,37.5,129756800,-1

01-16-2019,"Paul Cretien illustrates how to execute pairs trades in FAANG stocks 
FAANG is an acronym for the market s five most popular and best performing technology sector stocks  according to Investopedia  It includes  Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  and Google  NASDAQ GOOGL   GOOG  
The original acronym was FANG  then Apple was added to the group  They are viewed somewhat separately for the rest of the tech sector due to their relative youth and disruptive nature  The group itself provides numerous pairs trading opportunities that should yield profitable trades in 2019  Each stock s individual performance for 2018 is shown on the chart below 




As you can see  there is a general correlation among the stocks though their performance varies widely  The best pair trading opportunity throughout 2018 and heading into 2019 combined Amazon with Netflix  as their movement was highly correlated  but with enough difference in relative price volatility to create profitable trades 
Volatility differences provide the means for success in pairs trading  as the more stable member of the pair provides a landing place for the volatile member following each spike or dip in its price  For example  from July 8 through Aug  20  Netflix declined while Amazon increased at a slow  steady pace  Netflix grew at a much sharper pace in the first half of the year until its June peak  which provides a reversion to the mean trade with Amazon  We would look for similar profitable price changes between Netflix and Amazon in 2019 
Other pairs that may be spotted on  FAANG Stocks in 2018  include Apple and Amazon  Facebook and Google  Google and Apple  Apple and Amazon  Apple and Netflix and Amazon and Netflix  Of these pairs  the only one whose two members are too closely paired to be traded is Facebook and Google  For the others  an example trade is shown for each pair  with the more stable member listed first and bought  The more volatile stock is listed second and is sold at the beginning of the trade   The position is exited on the second date 
Of course  the example trades were made easier by selecting dates on the chart  In the real world  it will be up to the trader to follow the progress of the five FAANG stocks to see good pairs trading opportunities  The process is one of looking for a volatile stock that is currently highly priced relative to a less volatile stock  where both members of the pair have been observed over a period of time long enough for the trader to be acquainted with their typical price movements  or by using the lazy way with trades based on a long term chart  
Notice that volatility is relative and a stock that is considered the more volatile member of one pair may be considered the stable member when paired with a second stock or at a different date 
Well considered pairs trades should result in profitable opportunities with only low to moderate risk ",38.27,38.97,38.25,38.74,122278800,1

01-17-2019,"By Richard Lough PARIS  Reuters    Germany s  Siemens   DE SIEGn  and France s  Alstom   PA ALSO  agreed in 2017 to merge their rail assets  hoping to create a European industrial champion  But the EU s competition authority has doubts about the deal and could turn it down  despite the companies offering to take steps to clinch it  Siemens said on Thursday it was not prepared to make further concessions  meaning the merger s fate now likely rests in the hands of the European Commission  whose 28 commissioners are themselves split on the issue  The Commission has not commented publicly on its deliberations  beyond saying it will take a decision by Feb  18  French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has warned the EU s executive of a grave political error if it rejects the deal  His outspoken intervention reflects a frustration in Paris and some other European capitals that the EU s competition laws no longer reflect modern day geopolitical realities  and in particular the threat from China  WHAT S THE LATEST  Sources said Siemens planned no further concessions after it already offered to license parts of its high speed train business and sell parts of its signaling operations to allay the EU antitrust concerns  For its part  Alstom said it considered the proposed concessions already on the table  appropriate and adequate  to get the deal approved  The merger would create the world s second largest rail company  with combined revenues of around 15 billion euros   17 billion   That is roughly half the size of China s state owned CRRC Corp Ltd  SS 601766  but twice the size of Canada s Bombardier  TO BBDb    EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager worries the merger would stifle Europe s rail industry and has voiced doubts that China is likely to be a competitor on European railways in the near future  WHY IS IT SO POLITICALLY CHARGED  French President Emmanuel Macron champions a  Europe that protects   That includes protecting citizens from the threat to European jobs from Chinese firms  Europe  he says  needs to create industrial giants  like planemaker Airbus  PA AIR   to ensure its firms are not squeezed out of their own market  The Commission bases its judgment on EU competition law   ensuring that consumers have a choice that maintains downward pressure on prices in the European market  A weakness of the EU is its faith in an international rules based system  especially when others violate it  French officials say  By applying its antitrust rules to the letter  the EU may end up benefiting China more than its own economic area  the French argue  At the same time  officials in Brussels question whether bending competition rules to forge European champions is the best way to rein China in or teach it a lesson  In a sign of the Commission s splits  the French and German commissioners are speaking up internally about the need to take the Chinese threat into account in deciding whether the Siemens Alstom merger would hurt competition  European officials say  Several national regulators have opposed the deal or raised doubts about it  as have unions at the companies  making it hard for the Commission to overlook concerns  ARE THE EU LAW S OUTDATED  France s Le Maire says Europe needs to wake up  branding its competition laws  obsolete    One German official said the Commission struggled to see beyond the EU market   They haven t understood the way China works      it  is not a market economy  There s this EU bubble thing  they haven t seen the global tectonic shifts    Vestager says European champions cannot be built by undermining competition  and questions whether using competition policy is the best way to alter China s behavior   French officials acknowledge the debate is one that will not be resolved before a decision on Siemens Alstom is due  meaning the deal may end up becoming collateral damage  AREN T MACRON AND VESTAGER POLITICAL ALLIES  With a high profile in Brussels for attacking tax avoidance and monopoly powers among U S  multinationals  Vestager is widely talked about as a liberal who could win support beyond her party as the next Commission president  The former Danish economy minister hasn t announced any public bid for the job  but if she does she would likely need the backing of Macron  another liberal  whose party will compete in May s European elections for the first time  If she ultimately rejects the Siemens Alstom deal  it might taint her relations with Macron  Even so  French officials acknowledge that she has every reason to want to protect her reputation for applying the EU s rules firmly and fairly  earned via investigations into Google  O GOOGL  and Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   over taxes  no matter what the political cost  WHAT DOES THIS LEAVE THE MERGER  Tom Pick  a competition expert at law firm Fieldfisher in Brussels  said he had heard no noises from Vestager that suggested she had changed her mind as a result of the concessions offered by the companies   From what I see  what they are probably going to say is a prohibition  unless they have decided to market test again and have come to a different view   Pick

that the United States and China have imposed on each other s imports since mid 2018  foreign investment in China actually rose 3 percent last year over the previous year  Foreign investment to India rose 7 percent  Alan Jope  chief executive of consumer goods company  Unilever   L ULVR   said the United States remains a good market for its products  which include Dove deodorant  Magnum ice cream and Lipton tea   But it is China  where Unilever last year joined forces with ecommerce giant JD com  O JD  to move its products around the country  that has become the more resilient market  Jope said China was  one of our most reliable sources of growth  China provides the new stability in consumer consumption   RIPPLE EFFECTS The U S  China trade war has hit industries around the world over the past few months  Big Chinese companies such as  Alibaba   N BABA  have shrunk their plans to invest in the United States  Taiwan based Foxconn  TW 2354  has scaled back its plans for a Wisconsin factory  and Chinese automaker GAC Motor  GACHA UL  has also delayed a move into the U S  market  In September  Austria s fiber producer Lenzing halted a planned U S  expansion  blaming rising tariffs between the United States and China  Chinese textile exports to the U S  are among the goods facing tariffs  Lenzing mothballed a  322 million project in Alabama to focus on setting up a new production facility in Thailand  To be sure  foreign companies are still investing  particularly in the auto industry  Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  said earlier this month that it would invest  800 million to build a new electric car at its plant in Chattanooga  Tennessee  Toyota and Mazda are working on a new assembly plant  and Daimler and BMW are investing in existing operations  But the economic malaise driven by the upending of trade flows is hitting tech companies hard due to both supply chain disruption and the economic slowdown in China   Apple  O AAPL  this month warned of disappointing quarterly revenues  citing slowing iPhone demand in China   Samsung Electronics Co Ltd   KS 005930   the world s biggest maker of smartphones and the manufacturer of chips for other smartphone makers including Apple and Huawei  said its fourth quarter profit likely dropped 29 percent   For the long run    I worry that the trend will expand to many other countries and industries  and at that time    we all will be negatively affected   Ken Hu  deputy chairman of China s Huawei Technologies  HWT UL   said in Davos  Huawei  the world s biggest producer of telecommunications equipment  is  probably suffering the most right now  because it relies on heavily integrated and globalised supply chains  Hu said  TRUMP LOOMS LARGE As a result of the disruption  Trump s trade war with Chinese President Xi Jinping is looming large over Davos this year  even if neither man is here   The International Monetary Fund trimmed its global growth forecasts on Monday and a survey by auditing and accounting giant PwC of nearly 1 400 chief executives showed increasing pessimism among business chiefs  The PwC research showed 27 percent of executives from outside the United States see the United States as the number one place with the most potential for growth  down from 46 percent in 2018  It s not only economics that is clouding the skies  Foreign companies  mainly Chinese  also face tighter scrutiny when they bring deals to the United States  after the Trump administration last year strengthened the powers of the Committee on Foreign Investment  CFIUS   said Stuart Eizenstat  former U S  ambassador to the European Union and now head of law firm Covington   Burlington LLP s international practice  CFIUS is an intra agency panel that reviews acquisitions on national security grounds  Chinese state owned Sinochem Group  SASADA UL   which has been in merger talks with ChemChina to create the world s biggest industrial chemicals firm  said that it did not think it could clinch a U S  acquisition in the current environment   You know what s happening today  so I think you will see there will be less investment going abroad   Sinochem Chairman Ning Gaoning said   The Chinese are getting quite confused  They thought they were welcome to invest in other countries  Now they realize they are not being welcomed all the time   Takeshi Niinami  chief executive of Japanese brewer Suntory Holdings Ltd  SUNTH UL   told Reuters in an interview that the world has  very big emotional leaders  including one in the Washington        Davos is a body to work on one voice  to give  a message that says    Come on  we have to be rational    he said   Business should be the one to let them cool down

Apple warned after the Jan  2 market close revenue would come in at about  84 billion  down from its own projection of  89 billion to  93 billion but 8 8  from a year ago  Just about all of the short fall will come from China and  more specifically  disappointing sales of iPhones 
The announcement stunned investors and sent the Dow Jones industrials down 660 points the next day  although Apple s shares are now about flat on the year 
China has emerged as a huge challenge because of the Sino U S  trade wars that have slowed growth on the mainland and the competition with lower priced smart phones from Huawei  Samsung  KS 005930  and others 
The report and CEO Tim Cook s presentation will also generate a lot of questions about iPhones sales outside China as well  Some reports have said U S  sales are  static

01-29-2019,"Investing com   Shares of Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  were rising after hours after the tech giant reported a rare revenue decline due to slow iPhone sales in China and elsewhere  But the company produced the results it had told investors to expect in early January 
Shares were trading at  160 19  up 5 5  in after hours trading  Shares were off 1  to  154 68 in regular trading 
Apple said it earned  4 18 a share in its fiscal first quarter  a penny better than expected  Revenue of  84 3 billion was slightly better than the Street    and company    estimate of  84 billion  Still  revenue overall was down 4 5   For the second fiscal quarter  the company sees revenue at  55 billion to  59 billion  a touch lower than the Street estimate of  58 97 
Revenue from iPhone sales fell 15  from a year ago to  52 billion  the company said  with much of the weakness coming from business in China  The company said sales in Greater China fell a whopping 27  to  13 2 billion  largely because of Sino American trade tensions and weakness in the Chinese economy  In addition  Apple has been facing intense competition from other smartphone makers offering products at much lower prices 
Other businesses at Apple reported gains 
Apple stunned investors after the Jan  2 market close by warning that first quarter results would be weaker than it expected  Apple usually beats its own projections  The shares fell to as low as  142 the next day  They re up more than 13  since and are up 1 4  for the month  But the shares are still down more than 31  since peaking in September 
The good news from the report was services revenue jumped 19  in the quarter to  10 9 billion  Sales of Macintosh computers grew 9  to  7 4 billion  IPad sales were up 17  to  6 7 billion  Wearable product sales soared 33   As CEO Tim Cook has noted  the wearables and services businesses are not dependent on business in China

01-29-2019," Bloomberg     The U S  and China are sitting down Wednesday for the first of two days of high level talks aimed at finding a solution to a trade war that s casting a growing shadow on both of the world s two largest economies  But don t hold your breath for a deal 
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin  who remains the most prominent advocate of a deal in the Trump administration  on Tuesday told the Fox Business Network he expected  significant progress  in this week s talks 
Administration officials and other people familiar with the state of play  however  say the two sides remain far apart on key issues  with the U S  side still engaged in an internal debate over how to proceed and ill prepared for this week s meetings  The U S  s unveiling this week of criminal charges against Chinese corporate giant Huawei Technologies Co  isn t helping the mood 
The two days of talks between delegations led by Xi Jinping s top economic emissary  Liu He  and President Donald Trump s trade tsar  Robert Lighthizer  are the highest level negotiations since the two leaders sat down for dinner Dec  1  They come in the wake of lower level talks this month in Beijing and after a period of market turmoil that has left both governments eager to publicly claim progress to calm investors  nerves 
In a sign of the importance the White House is placing on the talks  Trump is expected to meet Liu while he s in Washington  In addition to U S  demands for structural reforms in China s economic policy and key concessions on issues such as intellectual property  the latest round of talks will cover Beijing s pledge to buy more American goods 
Lighthizer s office didn t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on Tuesday  People familiar with the U S  s internal discussions  however  say Trump appears to want to strike a deal  The stakes remain high ahead of a March 1 deadline that  if talks fail  could see the U S  raise tariffs on  200 billion in imports from China to 25 percent from 10 percent  a result neither side is keen to see happen 
But just how to craft a deal that s politically acceptable in an increasingly hawkish Washington remains unclear  people familiar with the discussions said  Too many issues are on the table  leading to what some see as a potential gridlock in the talks 
U S  officials have expressed frustration over an internal split between those like Mnuchin who favor making a deal with China and others who advocate a tougher approach  including Lighthizer  which combined with Trump s unpredictability has created a chaotic policy making process  according to people familiar with the deliberations 
Low Expectations
For experts  expectations remain low for any meaningful progress this week 
 At the end of the week we ll probably get some fairly bland statements suggesting that talks made progress    David Dollar  a former U S  Treasury representative in China now at the Brookings Institution  told a conference on Tuesday   I don t think they can hammer it out in the next few days   
Senior U S  officials are said to remain mindful of the limits of their ability to agree to something meaningful with Trump having rejected proposals brought to him in the past  The politics of any deal are also growing more complicated as Trump s standing in the polls has been falling again after his gambit to shut down the government to force Congress to approve funding for a wall on the Mexican border went wrong 
 The only person who can cut a deal is Donald Trump  But it s difficult for him to do so under the current circumstance because he is facing a lot of criticism domestically    said Cheng Li  research director of the Brookings  John L  Thornton China Center 
Economic Slowdown
Trump has made much of China s economic slowdown  arguing that it increases pressure on Xi to strike a deal  But the U S  economy and U S  companies are also beginning to see damage from the trade war 
The non partisan Congressional Budget Office on Monday said it expected that Trump s tariffs on steel  aluminum  and Chinese goods would cut the U S  s real gross domestic product by at least 0 1 percent on average through 2029  It also predicted overall U S  GDP growth would slow to 2 3 percent this year  1 7 percent in 2020  and 1 6 percent in 2021 
Mnuchin on Tuesday acknowledged that growth has slowed in Europe and China  but said he didn t expect that to dent U S  growth that he insisted wasn t being hit by the trade dispute with China   There is still a very good case for 3 percent growth this year   he said 
The business community remains more anxious about slowing growth in China and the prospect that the tariffs complicating life for many companies will remain in place for the foreseeable future 
Apple  Harley
Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL   on Tuesday reported a steep drop in sales in Greater China  representing almost  5 billion of lost revenue  Harley Davidson Inc  NYSE HOG   earlier in the day said it barely broke even in the last quarter of 2018 after getting caught up in Trump s trade wars  On Monday   Caterpillar  Inc  NYSE CAT   reported its biggest quarterly profit miss in a decade amid the China slowdown  sending its shares tumbling 
U S  companies and trade associations have fought the tariffs at every step  While they agree action is needed to address allegations of intellectual property theft and other unfair trade practices  they say the duties are the wrong approach 
 What we don t support is the development of a trade war  which is being developed and waged through mounting tariffs    Thomas Donohue  president of the U S  Chamber of Commerce  said this month ",39.06,39.53,38.53,38.67,166348800,-1
01-29-2019," Bloomberg     Gold advanced to an eight month high as investors awaited clues about the outlook for U S  monetary policy  with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell scheduled to hold a news conference later Wednesday after the central bank s inaugural rate setting meeting of 2019 
Spot bullion rose as much as 0 2 percent to  1 314 22 an ounce  the highest level since May  and was at  1 313 80 at 11 a m  in Singapore  The precious metal is up 2 4 percent this year and is heading for a fourth straight monthly gain  while a gauge of the U S  dollar is down for a third month 
The precious metal is seeing renewed interest as a store of value as investors weigh prospects of fewer U S  rate hikes this year and track signs of slower global growth amid the U S  China trade war  Bloomberg Economics  early indicator showed China s economy slowed further in January  while companies like Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL   and  Caterpillar  Inc  NYSE CAT    are feeling the pain  The delay of U S  government data after the partial shutdown  as well as the negotiations over Britain s Brexit deal  have also added to uncertainty in financial markets 
While the two largest economies are holding talks this week aimed at finding a solution to the trade war  the U S  s criminal charges against China s Huawei Technologies Co  have fueled tensions  That lessens the prospects of any major deal  according to John Sharma  an economist at National Australia Bank Ltd 
 Provide Support 
 Moreover  with easing economic activity  the possibility of further rate hikes remains less assured than it was in 2018  which will likely provide support to gold   Sharma said in an email   Investors are likely to follow Powell s comments on the outlook for the economy and  by extension  the likelihood  or not  of future rate rises  
While the Fed hiked four times last year  officials have indicated a willingness to be patient and flexible in their approach to additional increases  The latest Bloomberg survey of economists showed respondents pushed back the timing of expected hikes in 2019  but not the number  sticking with a forecast for two moves  A majority said they now expect those to come in June and December  instead of March and September  as predicted in a similar survey a month ago 
Powell will step up the Fed s communication efforts this year  with plans to hold a press conference to explain the bank s stance after all eight policy meetings  That s twice the number held in 2018 
Investor sentiment in gold remains strong  with holdings in bullion backed exchange traded funds at the highest since April 2013 after about 61 metric tons were added this year 
In other precious metals  silver traded near the highest since July  platinum added 0 2 percent and palladium was little changed ",39.06,39.53,38.53,38.67,166348800,1

The official PMI survey is due out  on Jan  31  along with a sister survey on services  The Caixin manufacturing PMI will come out  on Feb  1 and its services PMI  on Feb  3 ",39.06,39.53,38.53,38.67,166348800,1

 Reuters    CVS Health  NYSE CVS  Corp s health insurer Aetna  NYSE AET  on Tuesday said it is working with Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL  on a new health app for Apple Watches that uses an individual s medical history to set personalized health goals 
Called  Attain   the Apple Watch app will reward Aetna customers for meeting activity goals and fulfilling recommended tasks  such as getting vaccinations or refilling medications  with a subsidy toward the cost of an Apple Watch or gift cards for U S  retailers 
Several insurers have offered such subsidies for using wearable devices to meet generic activity goals such as a number of steps in the past  But what is new and significant about the Attain app is the use of personal health data held by Aetna to provide customized goals and recommendations 
That health history data is tightly regulated by the U S  government  and Apple and Aetna had to enter into what is known as a business associate agreement in order for Aetna to share it with the Apple 
Access to regulated data is necessary for some of the functions of the app  such as recommending age appropriate exercise or a lower cost option for scheduled lab tests or MRI imaging tests  Aetna said the program is voluntary and that data gathered will not be used for premium pricing or coverage decisions 
 We understand that you don t need to be a personal trainer or work out several hours a day to be healthier   Alan Lotvin  executive vice president for transformation at CVS Health  said in a statement 
For Apple  the Aetna partnership continues a push into regulated areas as the company dives further into health features with its wearable device launched in 2014 
Last fall  Apple announced a watch with the ability to take an electrocardiogram  an electrical measure of heart activity that can detect heart problems  The feature required clearance from the U S  Food and Drug Administration 
Aetna users can opt to share their information anonymously with Apple  Apple will use techniques such as machine learning to fine tune the app  such as detecting the users are more likely to follow up on tasks if they notified midday rather than in the morning 

 As we learn over time  the goal is to make more customized recommendations that will help members accomplish their goals and live healthier lives   Jeff Williams  NYSE WMB   Apple s chief operating officer  said in a statement ",39.06,39.53,38.53,38.67,166348800,1

01-30-2019,By Joel Schectman and Christopher Bing WASHINGTON  Reuters    A team of former U S  government intelligence operatives working for the United Arab Emirates hacked into the iPhones of activists  diplomats and rival foreign leaders with the help of a sophisticated spying tool called Karma  in a campaign that shows how potent cyber weapons are proliferating beyond the world s superpowers and into the hands of smaller nations  The cyber tool allowed the small Gulf country to monitor hundreds of targets beginning in 2016  from the Emir of Qatar and a senior Turkish official to a Nobel Peace laureate human rights activist in Yemen  according to five former operatives and program documents reviewed by Reuters  The sources interviewed by Reuters were not Emirati citizens  Karma was used by an offensive cyber operations unit in Abu Dhabi comprised of Emirati security officials and former American intelligence operatives working as contractors for the UAE s intelligence services  The existence of Karma and of the hacking unit  code named Project Raven  haven t been previously reported  Raven s activities are detailed in a separate story published by Reuters today  The ex Raven operatives described Karma as a tool that could remotely grant access to iPhones simply by uploading phone numbers or email accounts into an automated targeting system  The tool has limits   it doesn t work on Android devices and doesn t intercept phone calls  But it was unusually potent because  unlike many exploits  Karma did not require a target to click on a link sent to an iPhone  they said  In 2016 and 2017  Karma was used to obtain photos  emails  text messages and location information from targets  iPhones  The technique also helped the hackers harvest saved passwords  which could be used for other intrusions  It isn t clear whether the Karma hack remains in use  The former operatives said that by the end of 2017  security updates to Apple Inc s iPhone software had made Karma far less effective  Lori Stroud  a former Raven operative who also previously worked at the U S  National Security Agency  told Reuters of the excitement when Karma was introduced in 2016   It was like   We have this great new exploit that we just bought  Get us a huge list of targets that have iPhones now    she said   It was like Christmas   The disclosure of Karma and the Raven unit comes amid an escalating cyber arms race  with rivals such as Qatar  Saudi Arabia and the UAE competing for the most sophisticated hacking tools and personnel  Tools like Karma  which can exploit hundreds of iPhones simultaneously  capturing their location data  photos and messages  are particularly sought after  veterans of cyberwarfare say  Only about 10 nations  such as Russia  China and the United States and its closest allies  are thought to be capable of developing such weapons  said Michael Daniel  a former White House cyber security czar under President Obama  Karma and similar tools make personal devices like iPhones the  juiciest of targets   said Patrick Wardle  a former National Security Agency researcher and Apple security expert  A spokeswoman for UAE s Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined to comment  Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL  declined to comment  A FLAW IN APPLE S IMESSAGE SYSTEM The former Raven insiders said Karma allowed the operatives to gather evidence on scores of targets   from activists critical of the government to regional rivals  including Qatar  and the UAE s ideological opponent  the Islamic political Muslim Brotherhood movement  It also granted them access to compromising and at times sexually explicit photos of targets  The material was described to Reuters in detail but reporters didn t inspect it  Reuters saw no evidence that the UAE leaked damaging materials discovered through Karma  Raven was largely staffed by U S  intelligence community veterans  who were paid through an Emirati cyber security firm named DarkMatter  according to documents reviewed by Reuters  The company did not respond to numerous emails and phone calls requesting comment  The NSA declined to comment on Project Raven  The UAE government purchased Karma from a vendor outside the country  the operatives said  Reuters could not determine the tool s creator  The operatives knew how to use Karma  feeding it new targets daily  in a system requiring almost no input after an operative set its target  But the users did not fully understand the technical details of how the tool managed to exploit Apple vulnerabilities  People familiar with the art of cyber espionage said this isn t unusual in a major signals intelligence agency  where operators are kept in the dark about most of what the engineers know of a weapon s inner workings  Three former operatives said they understood Karma to rely  at least in part  on a flaw in Apple s messaging system  iMessage  They said the flaw allowed for the implantation of malware on the phone through iMessage  even if the phone s owner didn t use the iMessage program  enabling the hackers to establish a connection with the device  To initiate the compromise  Karma needed only to send the target a text message   the hack then required no action on the part of the recipient  The operatives could not determine how the vulnerability worked  A person with direct knowledge of the deal confirmed Karma s sale to the Emiratis from an outside vendor  details of its capabilities and its reliance on an iMessage vulnerability  The Raven team successfully hacked into the accounts of hundreds of prominent Middle East political figures and activists across the region and  in some cases  Europe  according to former Raven operatives and program documents  TARGETING THE  IRON WOMAN  OF YEMEN In 2017  for instance  the operatives used Karma to hack an iPhone used by Qatar s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al Thani  as well as the devices of Turkey s former Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet  im ek  and Oman s head of foreign affairs  Yusuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah  It isn t clear what material was taken from their devices   im ek  who stepped down from his position in July  told Reuters the cyber intrusion on his phone was  appalling and very disturbing   The Washington embassies of Qatar  Oman and Turkey did not respond to multiple emails and calls requesting comment about the targeting of political figures in their countries  Raven also hacked Tawakkol Karman  a human rights activist known as the Iron Woman of Yemen  Informed by Reuters she had been targeted  she said she believes she was chosen because of her leadership in Yemen s Arab Spring protests  which erupted around the region in 2011 and led to the ousting of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak  For years she had received repeated notifications from social media accounts  warning that she had been hacked  she told Reuters  But the fact that Americans helped the Emirati government monitor her was shocking  she said  Americans are  expected to support the protection of human rights defenders and provide them with all protection and security means and tools   she said   not to be a tool in the hands of tyrannies to spy on the activists and to enable them to oppress their peoples     By Joel Schectman and Christopher Bing in Washington  Editing by Ronnie Greene  Jonathan Weber and Michael Williams

01-31-2019," Bloomberg     Corporate America is taking the gloves off in its campaign to end President Trump s trade war 
A coalition of more than 200 trade associations spanning agriculture  manufacturing  retail  technology  oil and even liquor will begin a new two pronged attack next week to try to end the policies they see as damaging  The campaign  called Tariffs Hurt the Heartland  will involve blanketing Capitol Hill with farmers and other business owners  plus debuting an ad aimed at parents that essentially says the trade war might be endangering babies 
The escalation comes at a crucial time  The president and Chinese officials are meeting this week with just a month to go before U S  tariffs on  200 billion of Chinese imports are slated to more than double to 25 percent  It also marks a shift in strategy  After a year of struggling to directly sway Trump and his inner circle  including running ads on Fox News    his favorite cable channel    corporate lobbyists are ratcheting up pressure outside the White House 
 People have to think through different strategies because the normal operating procedure doesn t work   said Matt Priest  chief executive officer of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America  which is part of the wider coalition   Some of that strategy is paying off  but the response isn t the response we would ve liked  
D C  Bound
Next week  about 100 executives and business owners from companies big and small will visit Washington to lobby Congress  especially the large freshmen class    mostly Democrats    that may still be formulating their stances on trade  Support is also needed for a bipartisan bill intended to rein in the president s trade authority 
The group descending on Washington includes people like Brent Bible  who runs a 5 000 acre corn and soybean farm in Romney  Indiana  Soybeans were hit by retaliatory Chinese tariffs last year  pushing down prices to a point where farmers no longer make money  His farm also took a hit when U S  levies on steel and aluminum made equipment pricier 
 Just get it fixed   said Bible  who holds an economics degree  If this dispute goes on much longer  he said he worries about a  snowball effect  that could make soybeans almost worthless  Bible voted for Trump but said his support has waned in recent months   If we don t get a deal soon  then we are looking at a major long term impact  
This coalition was formed in September  and its activities so far have included hosting anti tariff events across the country that generated local media attention and publishing stats on the impact of the trade war  The new push takes that further  It will include a press conference on Feb  6 with a bipartisan group of senators  including Democrat Mark Warner and Republican Pat Toomey  who crafted the bill to reduce presidential trade powers 
Infant Plea
The coalition also had a new ad that tries to tug at the heartstrings of Americans by getting them to feel the pain it says Trump s trade war is causing  The spot  which will first run online in Washington and swing states like Ohio and Pennsylvania  features Cribs for Kids  a Pittsburgh based charity that sells 100 000 low cost portable baby beds a year to local governments and hospitals  The partners then give them to low income families  who might not have one otherwise 
In the ad  the nonprofit s executive director  Judy Bannon  says Trump s tariffs are increasing costs for the cribs it imports from China  The charity has already seen a decline in orders after a 10 percent levy on Chinese goods last year  Bannon said in an interview  She paints the impact in life and death terms  saying that getting babies to sleep in cribs and on their backs    a message reinforced on the charity s cribs    reduces Sudden Infant Death Syndrome 
 As a nonprofit  we never thought tariffs would affect us  but they do   Bannon says in the 30 second video  The spot also tries to drive home the point that tariffs are essentially taxes on U S  companies  despite Trump s Twitter proclamations that China is the one paying the duties   President Trump says that China is paying these tariffs  but I see the cost on my invoices  
Despite strong opposition from corporate America and the lobbying infrastructure it bankrolls  thwarting Trump on trade hasn t been easy  The impact of the tariffs is still small when compared with the overall U S  economy and hasn t resulted in widespread price increases for consumers  Several lobbyists noted that the government shutdown ended only when airports were disrupted  and that kind of bellwether event hasn t materialized yet with tariffs  The administration has done its part by avoiding hitting consumer products directly to blunt public outcry 
And because the trade war is promoted by the White House  most of America s CEOs have remained publicly silent  for fear of getting criticized publicly by Trump or raising the ire of the administration officials overseeing tariff exemptions  That s a far cry from 2017  when executives complained on TV and in congressional testimony in a successful bid to kill the border adjustment tax backed by former Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan 
Little Victories
To be sure  there have been victories in corporate America  Lobbyists for farmers  seen as a crucial part of Trump s base  pushed the administration to authorize  12 billion in relief funds after Beijing retaliated with its own tariffs  Trade groups also got plenty of items taken off the final tariff lists  including car booster seats for kids  They also point to Trump delaying the next tariff hike by two months to March to allow for more negotiations 
The timing of this escalated opposition could be helpful  The president just took a hit from the government shutdown  The political calendar has already turned to the 2020 presidential race  and Trump needs a strong economy for his re election bid  That story is harder to tell with almost daily reports of U S  companies    from Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL   to Stanley Black   Decker Inc  NYSE SWK      partly blaming weak results on the trade war 
 A lot things are coming to a head   said Gary Shapiro  CEO of the Consumer Technology Association  another coalition member  With Trump s re election bid looming   do you think he s going to risk a stock market fall over a 25 percent tariff    at this point  But I don t know anyone who has been right calling Trump s moves  ",41.53,42.25,41.14,41.61,162958400,-1

HONG KONG  Reuters    Factory activity shrank across much of Asia in January  falling to the weakest in years in several countries and adding to worries that trade tariffs and cooling demand in China pose an increasing threat to global growth 
The weak Purchasing Managers Index  PMI  readings reinforce expectations that central banks in Asia will put any further interest rate hikes on hold this year 
In some countries  such as China  Australia and India  there is even chatter about potential rate cuts 
Trade focused Asia appears to be suffering the most visible loss of momentum so far  but the euro zone economy is stuck in low gear and many emerging markets are sputtering 
The U S  economy  while a bit wobbly of late  still looks set to post solid growth  though softer than last year s pace 
That puts pressure on Beijing to come up with more stimulus measures at its upcoming parliamentary meeting in March and find common ground with the United States to prevent their trade war from escalating  with a truce expiring next month 
 The slowing down of the manufacturing sector in Asia continues   said Irene Cheung  Asia strategist at ANZ 
 A lot depends on whether the U S  and China come to a reasonable deal  Then we can actually avert this potential trade recession  but at the moment it s all tentative  
U S  President Donald Trump said on Thursday he will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping soon to try to seal a comprehensive trade deal as Trump and his top trade negotiator both cited substantial progress in two days of high level talks 
Trump  speaking at the White House during a meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He  said he was optimistic that the world s two largest economies could reach  the biggest deal ever made  
Meanwhile  bleak factory gauges suggests that the global economy will get worse before it gets better 
China s factory activity shrank by the most in almost three years in January as new orders slumped further and output fell  the private Caixin Markit PMI survey showed  The numbers were weaker than Thursday s official PMI survey 
Taiwan posted its weakest readings since September 2015  South Korea the joint lowest since November 2016 and Indonesia the first contraction in a year 
Japan s factory activity was the slowest in 29 months  with weakening exports and output suggesting it could soon fall into contraction  Manufacturers in the world s No 3 economy are facing both falling exports and a likely slump in domestic demand when the country s sales tax is hiked in October 
Freight rates for dry bulk and container ships  carriers of most of the world s raw materials and finished goods  have plunged over the last six months 
The Baltic Dry Index  a measure of ship transport costs for materials like iron ore and coal  has fallen by 47 percent since mid 2018  when the main tariffs were imposed 
A Reuters poll of hundreds of economists from around the world showed a synchronized global economic slowdown was under way  with growth forecasts cut for 33 of 46 economies 
The International Monetary Fund last week cut its world growth forecasts for this year and next and said failure to resolve protectionism could further destabilize the slowing global economy 
Those concerns were reinforced on Monday by sales warnings from  Caterpillar   NYSE CAT  and Nvidia Corp  coming on the heels of similar alarms raised by Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL   FedEx Corp  NYSE FDX  and a host of chipmakers

Veteran China watchers typically advise taking its data early in the year with a pinch of salt  suspecting the trends may be distorted by the timing of the Lunar New Year holidays 
Many firms scale back operations or close for long periods around the holidays  which begin on Feb  4 this year 
However  workers  business owners and labor activists have told Reuters that companies are shutting earlier than usual as the trade war bites  with some likely to close for good 
So far  China has fast tracked infrastructure projects  cut taxes and pumped liquidity into the financial system to help keep cash starved firms afloat  It has also been guiding down borrowing costs 
Investors are closely watching to see if Beijing unveils more fiscal stimulus during the upcoming parliamentary meeting in March  including bigger tax cuts  though the effects of policy easing are not expected to steady the economy until the second half of the year 
Chinese leaders  with an eye on a mountain of debt  have vowed they will not resort to massive stimulus like that deployed in past downturns  But some analysts believe more aggressive measures such as rate cuts are possible if conditions sharply deteriorate 
 Although we believe  China s  GDP growth will eventually bottom out  markets do not appear to have factored in such a sharp slowdown and may still be putting  in our opinion  too much faith in the efficacy of government support   economists at Nomura said in a recent note 
Even then  some economists say support measures may only steady activity in China and not produce a strong rebound in its demand like that which helped pull the global economy out of recession after the financial crisis 
 The global outlook is a bit more at risk from China today than it was  say  two or three years ago   said Sonal Desai  chief investment officer at Franklin Templeton Fixed Income

 Reuters     Snap Inc   NYSE SNAP  said the number of people using its Snapchat app would remain at current levels this quarter  easing worries the company would continue to lose users to rival Facebook  NASDAQ FB  Inc s Instagram and sending its shares up more than 20 percent 
The photo messaging app  known for its disappearing messages and filters that turn people into dogs or even tacos  has struggled since going public in March 2017  as Instagram has replicated many of its novel features  A controversial redesign also alienated some of Snapchat s advertisers and users 
In the fourth quarter Snap topped Wall Street with 186 million daily active users  flat with the previous quarter and down 1 million from the same period a year ago  Analysts  average expectation was 184 91 million  according to Refinitiv data 
 We do not foresee a sequential decline in daily active users in Q1 2019   said Lara Sweet  Snap s interim chief financial officer  during a call with analysts after reporting results  She gave no specific outlook on user numbers 
Snap shares jumped 22 percent to  8 62 after hours  That is still less than half the  17 initial public offering price 
The company avoided a third consecutive quarterly decline in users following its redesign  but some questioned the company s ability to grow 
 Snap s biggest issue continues to be that it lacks appeal beyond its core user base and has no visible direction on how to expand or pivot its app beyond that under 35 demographic   said Jessica Liu  a marketing analyst at Forrester 
NEW ANDROID APP
Snap has also begun rolling out its new Android app to a small percentage of Snapchat users  Chief Executive Evan Spiegel said during the post earnings call  Snap has said it rebuilt the Android app because it had more bugs and a worse user experience than its Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  iOS app 
The revamped app is key to gaining new users in developing markets  where devices running Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  s Android system are much more popular than iPhones 
 There s roughly 2 billion people  internationally  who are on Android and do not have Snapchat   Spiegel said   If we can take even a small percentage of that  it would make a big difference  
Snap s revenue  which it gets from selling advertising on the app  increased 36 percent to  389 8 million  beating Wall Street s average estimate of  377 52 million 
Revenue growth was helped in part by new ad formats like unskippable commercials on its original shows  which are housed on the Discover page  a panel on the app that contains publisher content along with influencer content 
Spiegel said during the call the company has improved the way it personalizes the Discover page for every user  which could attract more advertisers who were previously worried about their ads appearing next to unsuitable content 
Snap was now  substantially closer  to profitability  as it maintains a flat cost structure while increasing revenue  Spiegel said  In an internal memo that leaked in October  Spiegel set a goal of reaching profitability by the end of 2019 
Michael Pachter  an analyst at Wedbush Securities  estimates Snap will reach breakeven by the end of this year 
Average revenue per user was  2 09 during the fourth quarter  up from  1 53 in the year ago quarter 
That measurement of revenue grew the most for users outside North America and Europe  hitting  1 24 during the quarter  up from 56 cents in the year ago quarter 
The company s net loss narrowed to  191 67 million  or 14 cents per share  compared with  349 98 million  or 28 cents per share  a year earlier 

For the first quarter  Snap said it expects revenue of  285 million to  310 million  That compares with the average analyst estimate for revenue of  307 million  according to data from IBES Refinitiv ",43.22,43.77,43.09,43.54,127985200,1

Concerned that Amazon could be in limbo for more than a year ahead of the state panel s vote  the growing consensus within the company was that it did not make sense to move ahead in the face of persistent opposition with a headquarters in New York City  where it already has 5 000 employees   Amazon had no binding legal contracts to acquire or lease the land for the project  It could exit with relatively little pain  the people said  Company officials also concluded Amazon could shift the jobs that would have been created in New York to other corporate centers it has across the United States  from the San Francisco Bay Area to Boston  Reopening talks with former HQ2 contestants did not make sense  the people said   Gianaris blamed Amazon for the reversal   Amazon never showed willingness to look seriously at the concerns that were raised   he said  Still  up to the moment of the announcement  there were signs that the parties could work together  One union leader said he and other labor organizers met on Wednesday with Cuomo and four Amazon officials  including Brian Huseman  its vice president of public policy   We had such a productive meeting yesterday  Everyone left happy   said Stuart Appelbaum  head of the Retail  Wholesale and Department Store Union  The group is trying to organize workers at an Amazon facility in Staten Island  another New York City borough  despite the company s past opposition to unionization  
 It was a complete surprise that they would say they look forward to working with us  and we talked about next steps  and then they call it all off the next morning   said Appelbaum ",42.81,42.92,42.44,42.6,98507200,1

signs of weakness in U S  consumer spending despite recent signs of a slowdown   Shares of the world s largest retailer rose more than 3 percent on Tuesday in a broadly flat market  putting them up 7 percent so far this year   Walmart and rival  Target   NYSE TGT  Corp s unexpectedly strong growth in holiday sales reflected the health of the U S  consumer as spending remained robust due to a strong labor market and cheaper gasoline prices   We still feel pretty good about the consumer  We haven t seen much of a change   Walmart Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs told Reuters   The data we are seeing still looks pretty healthy  Gas prices are down year over year  which helps   Investors and Wall Street analysts have been expecting U S  spending to slow this year  against a backdrop of rising debt  trade tariffs and economic uncertainty  Walmart s results settled nerves  but some doubts remain    There are definitely some storm clouds on the horizon   said Charles Sizemore  founder of Sizemore Capital Management LLC  which owns Walmart shares   A big example would be delinquent loans in the auto sector which are rising     the consumer may be on hard times and in 2008 that was the prelude to the global economic slowdown   U S  retail sales recorded their steepest drop in more than nine years in December  the government reported last week  as receipts fell across the board  suggesting a sharp slowdown in economic activity at the end of 2018  However  overall sales for the 2018 U S  holiday shopping season hit a six year high as shoppers were encouraged by early discounts  according to a Mastercard  NYSE MA  report in late December  Walmart sales at U S  stores open at least a year rose 4 2 percent  excluding fuel  in the fourth quarter ended Jan  31  The gain exceeded analysts  expectations of 2 96 percent  according to IBES data from Refinitiv  Sales were boosted by federal officials distributing food stamp aid early during the partial government shutdown  The demise of retailer Toys R Us also helped Walmart gain toy market share  the company said  Adjusted earnings per share increased to  1 41 per share  beating expectations of  1 33 per share  according to Refinitiv  But the retailer s gross margins declined for the seventh consecutive quarter due to higher transportation costs and e commerce investments  ONLINE SALES JUMP Online sales jumped 43 percent in the quarter  in line with the previous quarter s rise  helped by the expansion of Walmart s online grocery pickup and delivery services and a broader assortment on its website  But the company reiterated that it expected e commerce losses to increase this year due to ongoing investments  Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon said on a conference call the company was focused on getting return customer visits and strengthening product assortment   The company has expanded a program that allows customers to order groceries online and pick them up at its U S  stores  a move the retailer said helped expand market share in the category  It said it will have the service at 3 100 stores by next January  At the end of the fourth quarter it was offered at more than 2 100 stores   Walmart will offer grocery deliveries to about 800 more stores by the end of the year  bringing the total to 1 600 stores   Grocery sales currently make up 56 percent of total revenue for the retailer  Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN  is trying to crack the food category  especially since it bought organic supermarket chain Whole Foods   Walmart is partnering with third party couriers and working with so called gig  or freelance  drivers  who are cheaper than full time employees  to push down costs  Reuters recently reported   Google backed Deliv  a Walmart delivery partner in Miami and San Jose  ended its relationship with the retailer  Reuters reported last week  The U S  retailer  which overtook Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL  to become the third largest e commerce retailer last year  is likely to capture a 4 6 percent share of the U S  e commerce market  behind eBay Inc  NASDAQ EBAY  and Amazon  according to research firm eMarketer  Walmart repeated its forecast that fiscal year 2020 earnings per share would decline in the low single digits in percentage terms  compared with last year  Excluding the acquisition of Indian e commerce firm Flipkart  it sees an increase in the low  to mid single digits  McMillon said the company was disappointed in India s revised e commerce regulations  which ban companies from selling products via firms in which they have an equity interest and also bar them from making deals with sellers to sell exclusively on their platforms  He said the Indian government didn t consult with Walmart and other U S  companies before it changed the rules   We hope for a collaborative regulatory process going forward  which results in a level playing field   he said   Walmart expects fiscal year 2020 comparable sales growth of 2 5 percent to 3 percent  excluding fuel and online sales growth of 35 percent  Total revenue increased 1 9 percent to  138 8 billion  beating analysts  estimates of  138 65 billion  Walmart has recorded 18 quarters

02-21-2019,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON  Reuters    New orders for key U S  made capital goods unexpectedly fell in December amid declining demand for machinery and primary metals  pointing to a sustained slowdown in business spending on equipment that could further crimp economic growth  The economy s outlook was also dimmed by other reports on Thursday showing a measure of factory activity in the mid Atlantic region contracted in February for the first time since May 2016 and home resales plunging to a more than three year low in January   The reports  together with data last week showing steep declines in retail sales in December and manufacturing output in January  strengthen the Federal Reserve s  patient  stance toward raising interest rates further this year  Minutes of the U S  central bank s Jan  29 30 policy meeting published on Wednesday noted that  some risks to the downside had increased  with regard to the outlook for the economy  The Fed left interest rates unchanged at that meeting and discarded promises of  further gradual increases  in borrowing costs   It appears the bloom is off the economic expansion rose   said Joel Naroff  chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland  Pennsylvania   The data don t paint a picture of strong growth going forward   The Commerce Department said orders for non defense capital goods excluding aircraft  a closely watched proxy for business spending plans  dropped 0 7 percent  Data for November was revised down to show these so called core capital goods orders falling 1 0 percent instead of declining 0 6 percent as previously reported  Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders rising 0 2 percent in December  Core capital goods orders increased 6 1 percent on a year on year basis   Shipments of core capital goods rose 0 5 percent in December after an unrevised 0 2 percent drop in the prior month  Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government s gross domestic product measurement   While the rebound in core capital goods shipments suggests continued moderate growth in business spending on equipment in the fourth quarter  the surprise drop in orders points to weakness in the months ahead   The December report was delayed by a 35 day partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on Jan  25  The Commerce Department said the  processing and data quality were monitored throughout  and response and coverage rates were at or above normal levels for this release   The dollar trimmed gains versus a basket of currencies on the data and stocks on Wall Street were trading lower  U S  Treasury prices fell  DARKENING CLOUDS The softening business spending outlook was highlighted by a another report on Thursday from the Philadelphia Fed showing its manufacturing activity index dropped to a reading of  4 1 this month from 17 0 in January  That was the first negative reading since May 2016   A reading below zero indicates contraction in the region s manufacturing sector  However  manufacturers in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania  southern New Jersey and Delaware remained generally upbeat about business conditions over the next six months  Business spending on equipment has been slowing since the second quarter of 2018  despite the White House s  1 5 trillion tax cut  Some companies including Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  used their tax windfall to buy back shares on a massive scale  A survey last month showed lower taxes had not caused companies to change hiring or investment plans  There was more bad news from the housing market  which has lagged other sectors  In a third report  the National Association of Realtors said existing home sales dropped 1 2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 94 million units last month  the lowest level since November 2015  But prospects for the housing market are improving  with mortgage rates declining to a one year low and house price inflation slowing  which could make home buying more appealing  For now  the weak housing market is more evidence that the economy struggled early in 2019 after hitting a soft patch in the fourth quarter   But the bigger picture is that a slowing economy  as well as the continued problem of a lack of inventory  will keep a lid on sales growth this year   said Matthew Pointon  property economist at Capital Economics in New York   A fourth report from the Conference Board showed a measure of future U S  economic activity slipped in January after being unchanged in December amid predictions of a considerable deceleration in growth by the end of 2019   JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  trimmed its GDP growth estimate for the fourth quarter of 2018 by one tenth of a percentage point to a 1 4 percent rate  The government will publish the fourth quarter GDP report next Thursday  The economy grew at a 3 4 percent pace in the third quarter  The economy s outlook has been clouded by fears of a sharp slowdown in global growth  especially in China and Europe  fading fiscal stimulus  trade tensions as well as uncertainty regarding Britain s departure from the European Union  Despite the darkening clouds  the labor market remains strong  though the trend in layoffs has been indicating some weakness  In a fifth report on Thursday  the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 23 000 to a seasonally adjusted 216 000 for the week ended Feb  16   But the four week moving average of initial claims  considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week to week volatility  rose 4 000 to 235 750 last week  the highest level since January 2018  
 It looks like the labor market has cooled lately  and this is not too surprising given that job growth has been robust in recent months despite other signs that the economy has slowed   said Daniel Silver  an economist at JPMorgan in New York ",42.95,43.09,42.58,42.76,68998800,1

BARCELONA  Reuters    China s Huawei welcomed comments from President Donald Trump about the future of U S  mobile communications on Sunday and asserted its position as a world leading smartphone producer as Washington and Beijing seek a trade war ceasefire 
U S  and Chinese negotiators are set to meet for a sixth straight day of negotiations on Sunday as they work to strike a deal ahead of a March 1 deadline on a trade dispute which has disrupted global commerce and slowed the world economy 
At the center of the imbroglio is Huawei Technologies  accused by Washington of sanctions busting  intellectual property theft and facilitating Chinese state espionage operations 
Speaking ahead of the mobile industry s biggest global event which begins in Barcelona on Monday  Huawei Chairman Guo Ping reiterated his company s position that it has never and would never allow any country to spy through its equipment 
Guo  who holds Huawei s rotating chairmanship  said Trump s recent assertion that the United States needed to get ahead in mobile communications through competition rather than seeking to block technology was  clear and correct  
Trump s tweets on Thursday did not specifically mention Huawei  the world s largest producer of mobile network equipment  but appeared to soften earlier U S  statements that it should be barred from Western networks on security grounds 
 I have noticed the president s Twitter  he said that the U S  needs faster and smarter 5G  or even 6G in the future  and he has realized that the U S  is lagging behind in this respect  and I think his message is clear and correct   Guo said  speaking through an interpreter 
He said the United States did not represent the whole world and called for equipment makers  network operators and governments to work together to devise trustworthy standards to manage cyber security risks 
 We need to have unified standard that should be verifiable  It should not be based on politics   Guo said

Huawei also sought to reaffirm its position as one of the world s leading technology companies  unveiling a folding 5G smartphone to an audience of media and analysts in Barcelona 
Huawei  the world s third largest smartphone vendor after Samsung  KS 005930  and Apple  said it had taken the lead in developing phones for 5G   which promises super fast internet speeds   because it was also involved in developing the networks 
The new Huawei Mate X will have two back to back screens which unfold to become an eight inch tablet display  and goes on sale later this year priced at 2 299 euros   2 607   setting a new upper limit for consumer smartphones 
Samsung had unveiled its own folding smartphone last week  priced at nearly  2 000  as part of a bid to top the technology of Chinese rivals and Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL  
Thomas Husson  principal analyst at Forrester Research  said the Mate X showed Huawei was an innovative technology company and no longer trailing American and Korean competitors 
 The fact that Huawei is not just a network equipment provider but also a smartphone manufacturer     gives them a competitive advantage for 5G  It is also a double edge sword as some argue the security risks are higher   Husson said 
China s Xiaomi  the world s fourth largest smartphone maker  also unveiled a 5G handset on Sunday  but without the folding screen or high price tags touted by the Huawei and Samsung devices  Xiaomi s offering will start at 599 euros   679  when it hits the market in May ",43.54,43.97,43.49,43.56,87493600,1

03-05-2019,"By Josh Smith SEOUL  Reuters    Perhaps none of the communist legacies shared by Vietnam and North Korea highlighted during Kim Jong Un s  goodwill visit  to Hanoi is stranger than the embalmed leaders on display in their capital cities  and the secretive team of Russian technicians that keeps the aging bodies looking ageless  Kim laid a wreath outside Ho Chi Minh s mausoleum in the Vietnamese capital on Saturday  after the conclusion of his shortened summit with U S  President Donald Trump  Inside the dark interior of the mausoleum  the embalmed corpse of Vietnam s founding father lies displayed in a glass coffin for a steady stream of tourists who silently shuffle by  In Pyongyang  Kim Jong Un s grandfather and father are on similar display in the loftily named Kumsusan Palace of the Sun  a monument to the cult of personality that surrounds North Korea s ruling family  All three leaders were originally preserved by a team of specialists from the so called  Lenin Lab  in Moscow  which first embalmed and displayed Vladimir Lenin s body in 1924   The Soviet Union may have collapsed  and socialism in both Vietnam and North Korea has taken on forms barely recognizable to the ideology s first thinkers  but that same lab still performs annual maintenance on Ho  and according to at least one researcher  still helps North Korea keep the Kims looking fresh   The original embalming and the regular re embalmings have always been conducted by the scientists of the Moscow lab   said Alexei Yurchak  a professor of anthropology at the University of California  Berkeley  who is writing a book about the embalmed communist leaders   Over the years they trained local scientists in some techniques  but not all  maintaining the core of the know how secret   BODY WORK Unlike earlier preservation processes such as mummification  the permanent embalming pioneered by Soviet scientists kept the bodies flexible  with unblemished skin and a lifelike  if rather waxy  pallor  With North Vietnam under regular attack by American warplanes at the time of Ho s death in 1969  the Soviet Union airlifted chemicals and equipment to a cave outside Hanoi  which the Soviet experts turned into a sterile lab  Yurchak said  When the Soviet Union collapsed in the 1990s  the government lab faced a funding crisis  leading it to rely more heavily on offering services to foreign clients  Yurchak said  Among those customers was North Korea  where Russian specialists embalmed both Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il at a laboratory built into the mausoleum in Pyongyang  The original embalming takes several months  and the bodies need regular upkeep   Every one and a half to two years  these bodies are re embalmed by the Moscow scientists   Yurchak said  citing interviews he conducted with lab scientists and his own field research   The website for the committee that manages Ho s mausoleum says Russia started charging for the chemicals after the Soviet Union collapsed  prompting Hanoi to ask that the supplies be produced in Vietnam  Vietnam has also sent technicians to study in Russia and can now handle the operations of the mausoleum by itself  the website says  A source with committee  however confirmed the monument is closed every year for two months and that Russian technicians help with annual maintenance of the body  When contacted by Reuters  the mausoleum lab in Moscow  which since 1992 has been known as the Center for Scientific Research and Teaching Methods in Biochemical Technologies  declined to comment on any aspect of its work   The North Korean delegation at the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment  Researcher Tom Fowdy  who founded a group promoting tourism and cultural engagements in North Korea  said he has seen the Kumsusan Palace closed for unexplained  renovations   but maintenance of the bodies is a mystery   While it is obvious the methodology was derived from Russia  it will be a closely kept secret   he said  Some experts say China  which relied on its own scientists to embalmed Mao Zedong because of tension between Beijing and Moscow at the time  may have taught or helped North Korea  CHANGING SYMBOLS Visitors to Pyongyang s Kumsusan Palace pass displays that include Kim Jong Il s personal yacht and an Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  computer the dictator had once owned  before being required to bow three times to the bodies   The personality politics of the Kims exceeds all others   Fowdy said  noting that maintaining the memorial will continue to  receive overwhelming priority  in North Korea s government budgeting  It s not clear how much impoverished North Korea spends on maintaining the Kims  bodies  When Moscow released preservation costs for the first time in 2016  it reported spending nearly  200 000 that year to maintain Lenin  Originally the embalming was seen as a way of joining the various countries to international communism  as embodied in Lenin   But as Vietnam and North Korea developed in their different political ways  so has the meaning attached to preserving the leaders  bodies   
 Today this original meaning of these bodies has changed   in Vietnam the body of Ho today stands for anti colonial struggles for independence and even for new nationalism  much more than for communism   Yurchak said   In North Korea the two Kims  bodies stand for a self sufficient country organized around one leader and existing in the face of the  imperialist surroundings   ",43.99,44,43.63,43.88,83569600,-1

03-07-2019," Bloomberg     Huawei Technologies Co   China s biggest smartphone maker  is using its financial and political clout to fight U S  allegations that the company was involved in bank fraud  technology theft and spying 
The effort probably won t work  American legal experts say 
 I don t see the U S  backing away from these cases   said Peter Henning  a former federal prosecutor who is now a professor at Wayne State University Law School in Detroit 
Huawei has aggressively fought U S  claims it can t be trusted by business or government  allegations at the core of two indictments  The company has lobbied countries around the world to ignore American warnings against its products  On Wednesday  Huawei filed a lawsuit saying the U S  broke the law by barring government agencies from using Huawei equipment in contracts  It s based on an argument that the company has been singled out for punishment by Congress in violation of the U S  Constitution without a fair chance to defend itself 
And given that all of this is playing out amidst prolonged negotiations between China and the U S  to resolve a trade war  there s intense speculation over how much the cases could be used as a bargaining chip for President Donald Trump

Huawei Goes on Legal Warpath With Twin North American Suits

The company s aggressive response to the criminal charges may reflect a desire to both circumvent the U S  justice system and combat claims that threaten billions of dollars in sales outside of China  said Alexander Capri  a visiting senior fellow at the National University of Singapore Business School 
 Huawei is in a public relations blitzkrieg   Capri said   Spying allegations have done damage to the company s image and  if a significant number of U S  allies were to block or restrict Huawei s access to either western tech or markets  the company would be in serious trouble  
China has become addicted to western technology components  and Huawei can t afford to get cut off from U S  suppliers  especially as it seeks to build the world s next generation of wireless modems  Capri said  Last year  the Trump administration banned Chinese company ZTE Corp  HK 0763   from purchasing critical U S  technology for violating export sanctions against Iran and North Korea  ZTE eventually paid more than  1 billion in fines 
Bombshell Arrest
But the Huawei prosecutions aren t likely to get sidetracked  U S  legal experts say  That s in part due to the high profile way in which they re been handled  with a bombshell arrest in Vancouver on Dec  1 of Meng Wanzhou  Huawei s chief financial officer and daughter of the company s founder  and a highly publicized press conference in Washington the following month when the indictments were unsealed 
In addition  the allegations at the heart of the two cases    that Huawei stole trade secrets from an American company and that it violated U S  sanctions on Iran    are issues that the Trump administration has made top priorities  While prosecutors can always drop cases  it s highly unlikely in this case    even if it would help trade talks  A settlement on the other hand might be a more reasonable goal for Huawei 
What Bloomberg Opinion Says
The quest for justice is everyone s right  yet Huawei risks coming off as belligerent instead of the calm and trustworthy partner it s trying to portray  And the irony of appealing to Canada s rule of law when no such option exists back home isn t lost on the hordes of critics who were already wary of this new charm offensive   Tim Culpan  columnistClick here to view piece 
 I guess Trump could order the Justice Dept to dismiss the indictment  but that would be unprecedented   Henning said 
To be sure  Trump is an unusual president  and international trade professor Alan Sykes said the cases could be used as leverage in the negotiations 
 There s many ways for prosecutors to pull back on what they re seeking   and U S  attorneys are subject to the commands of the Attorney General  who works for the president  said Sykes  a professor at Stanford Law School   There s a question of whether that s appropriate    if it compromises the independence of the Justice Department  But it s a logical possibility  
The prosecutions also may not interfere with trade negotiations  like when the European Union imposed billions of dollars of fines on Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  or levied tax penalties on Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL    Sykes said

The U S   citing security concerns  has urged allies to bar Huawei and other Chinese technology providers from building infrastructure for fifth generation  or 5G  mobile cellular networks  China has dismissed the allegations against Huawei  saying U S  actions are based on fear of facing a formidable industrial competitor 
In addition  it may be difficult for the U S  to backpedal on the Huawei prosecutions after the Trump administration announced a get tough initiative on China s business practices  In November  then Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the crackdown was intended to counter what he saw as a looming threat of China s economic espionage 
Trade Secrets
Among the enforcement actions being targeted were efforts by China to gain access to proprietary U S  technology and trade secrets  through techniques such as computer hacking or theft by insiders  Brooklyn U S  Attorney Richard Donoghue  whose office is prosecuting Meng s case  is on a list of the nation s top prosecutors on the Justice Department s Working Group for China 
And while Meng fights extradition from Canada    she too has filed a retaliatory suit  claiming the Canadians violated her constitutional rights during her arrest    the bank fraud and trade sanctions case that she s named in is moving forward all the same  Huawei is due to be arraigned in Brooklyn federal court on March 14  Both Meng and her company have denied any wrongdoing 
Given Meng s wealth and connections  she could drag out the extradition fight for years  But few have ever been successful in persuading a Canadian court not to extradite to the U S   said Brad Simon  a former federal prosecutor in Brooklyn  New York  who is now a partner at Phillips Nizer LLP 
So  for Meng  too  the most likely positive outcome would be for a relatively lenient plea deal  given that under federal law  the charges she faces in Brooklyn carry as much as 30 years in prison ",43.47,43.61,43.01,43.13,45448000,-1
03-07-2019,"BRUSSELS  Reuters    The European Commission has opened an investigation to examine whether tax rulings by Luxembourg amounted to state aid for Finnish food and drink packaging company Huhtamaki  it said on Thursday 
The Commission s formal investigation concerns three tax rulings in 2009  2012 and 2013  the earliest of which was disclosed in the so called  Luxleaks  media revelations  the Commission said 
The three tax rulings issued by Luxembourg allowed a company of the Huhtamaki group to  unilaterally deduct from its taxable base fictitious interest payments for the interest free loans it receives   the EU executive said  adding that it had doubts on whether this favorable tax treatment could be justified 
Member states should not allow companies to set up arrangements that unduly reduce their taxable profits and give them an unfair advantage over competitors  Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement 
 The Commission will carefully investigate Huhtamaki s tax treatment in Luxembourg to assess whether it is in line with EU State aid rules   she said 
The Luxembourg government said it did not offer illegal state aid to Huhtamaki and will respond to the European Commission 
The investigation follows the Commission s decisions to force Luxembourg to recover what it classed as illegal state aid given to Fiat  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and Engie through tax rulings

warning affixed to the dashboard of every off road Mahindra Roxor vehicle that Indian automaker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd assembles in a suburb north of Detroit  The motto might also apply to the Indian automaker s latest attempt to enter the U S  auto market   an effort Haas  a former executive at Ford Motor  NYSE F  Co and Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  Inc  is leading   GRAPHIC  Mahindra eyes U S  auto market as new car sales are poised to stall     A decade ago  Mahindra tried to break in to the U S  market with a low cost pickup truck  The foray ended in failure and a lawsuit from dealers demanding their franchise fees back  Haas  the automaker s North American chief executive  says this time Mahindra has a more cautious  pay as you go strategy   Instead of starting with a truck or passenger car  Mahindra is reintroducing its brand with the Roxor  a vehicle that looks like a vintage Jeep   Mahindra has built around 3 000 off road Roxors and is using the model  which starts at around  15 000  to demonstrate to American consumers and dealers  acutely aware of our previous experience  here that the Indian automaker can build a reliable product before it launches mainstream models for use on American roads  Haas told Reuters   Getting burned makes you cautious   Haas said  RICH PROSPECTS  BIG RISKS  Mahindra is one of a handful of European and Asian automakers gearing up to enter the U S  market in hopes of gaining sales as well as credibility that can boost their brands at home   France s PSA and China s Zotye and GAC all have outlined plans for establishing beachheads in the world s second largest market by sales  which offers rich pickings in segments including pickup trucks  SUVs and crossovers  But the United States is a mature market that most industry executives say is heading for a downturn  and it is already crowded with over 40 automotive brands and 300 plus models on sale   See graphic on annual U S  new car sales   There s not a line waiting out the front door of every potential newcomer to North America of people saying  I cannot wait for a new car to show up here today    said Larry Dominique  North American head of PSA  which has also taken a cautious approach to relaunching here   PSA announced last month the Peugeot brand will lead its U S  return   the same brand that crashed out of this market less than three decades ago  Analysts and auto executives say new entrants must stand out in a crowd to crack the U S  market  as Tesla Inc has with electric vehicles  Just offering a cheap car may not be enough  said Mark Wakefield  head of the North American automotive practice for consultancy AlixPartners  The higher quality of used vehicles presents a challenge  while delivering the expensive safety features American consumers and regulators demand    If you fail to deliver on that then you re a pariah in the market   he said  Prospective U S  entrants might look to the example of South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Co  the last foreign automaker to successfully enter the U S  car market  The Korean carmaker launched cheap models in the United States in 1986  as Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd had done before  Hyundai scored early successes  but quality problems set the brand back  and forced a relaunch  Now  it is overhauling its U S  strategy  shifting from sedans to SUVs  The problem for prospective entrants is that if they do find an untapped niche  consultants and analysts expect other automakers to rush to fill it themselves  A NEW STRATEGY  Mahindra s first foray into the U S  auto market was a disaster  as plans to launch a low cost pickup with high fuel efficiency never came to fruition  in part because it failed to meet federal emissions standards  Angry dealers who had signed on to sell the Scorpio pickup sued Mahindra  Mahindra regrouped  Haas set up Mahindra s U S  office in 2013 with just a handful of people  and that has risen to 450   The company decided not to go into direct competition with major automakers  but to enter the much smaller and less heavily regulated market for off road recreational vehicles sold mainly in rural America   The Roxor stands out because it looks like a World War II Jeep  Mahindra has had a license since the end of that war to make such vehicles in India  Municipalities  mining and construction companies  and many others seeking rugged off road vehicles have shown interest  Haas said  The Roxor also has caught the eye of the owner of the Jeep brand  Fiat Chrysler Automobiles  FCA  NV  a potential competitor whose U S  headquarters is just up the road from Mahindra s  Last August  FCA asked the U S  International Trade Commission to block Roxor sales because the model is too similar to its own Jeep   The commision has ruled FCA can pursue its intellectual property claims against the Roxor  but on Feb  21 Mahindra asked the agency to review that ruling  Mahindra has signed up a network of 390 powersports dealers all over the country to sell the Roxor  Haas said around a third of powersports dealers also own car dealerships so the Roxor allows him to establish the brand  then build relationships with car dealers    I can t say what our plans are  but the smoke is going to clear out of the air in the next year to 18 months   Haas said   Among the vehicles under consideration for the U S  market is the new Marazzo  a minivan designed by Mahindra s Michigan engineers for sale in India that has scored well in international crash safety tests and features Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  CarPlay  Instead of low prices  Mahindra plans to focus on its image of building rugged  durable vehicles for India s roads   We re India tough   Haas said   That s a value that resonates with a chunk of the population here    The speed of Mahindra s U S  rollout will depend not only on retail consumers but the U S  Postal Service  Haas said  The Postal Service is searching for its next generation of delivery vehicles and Mahindra is one of five finalists for the  6 billion project  which may be decided this year  
 That contract would make a fast  U S   entry easier  as you might imagine   Haas said   If it doesn t happen  then we have to decide what we re doing here  ",45.97,46.03,45.64,45.93,94318000,-1

03-19-2019,"By Ginger Gibson and Jonathan Stempel WASHINGTON NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  investigators sought warrants to read Michael Cohen s emails in July 2017  nine months before the FBI raided the home and office of President Donald Trump s former personal lawyer  according to documents made public on Tuesday  The requests were made six months into Trump s presidency  Emails were sought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller s office as well as by the FBI  dating back as far as June 2015  according to the documents   Mueller is investigating Russia s role in the 2016 U S  election and possible coordination with Trump campaign members  The nearly 900 pages of documents released by a federal judge in New York provide more detailed accounts of Cohen s financial relationships than previously known  Cohen had been Trump s personal lawyer and self described fixer for more than a decade  but began cooperating with federal investigators soon after the April 2018 raids on his home  office and hotel room  He later pleaded guilty in separate prosecutions to lying to Congress  bank fraud and campaign finance violations  The latter included paying hush money to silence two women who said they had sexual encounters with Trump  Cohen is scheduled to begin a three year prison term on May 6   Trump has denied having had sexual relationships with the two women  Stormy Daniels  the porn actress whose real name is Stephanie Clifford  and former Playboy model Karen McDougal  Much of the discussion about campaign finance issues in the released documents was redacted  They were released after U S  District Judge William Pauley on Monday ordered prosecutors to make redacted versions public  in response to requests by news media organizations  Lanny Davis  a lawyer for Cohen  said in a statement on Monday night that the document release  only furthers his interest in continuing to cooperate and providing information and the truth about Donald Trump and the Trump organization to law enforcement and Congress   Since pleading guilty  Cohen has publicly turned on Trump  telling the House Committee on Oversight and Reform on Feb  27 that his former boss was a  racist    con man  and  cheat   In his congressional testimony  Cohen said he was  ashamed of my weakness and misplaced loyalty  of the things I did for Mr  Trump in an effort to protect and promote him   Cohen began working for Trump in 2007  The Republican president in December called his former lawyer  a rat  and in January said Cohen was  lying to reduce his jail time   Moscow has denied meddling in the 2016 election  though U S  intelligence agencies have concluded that it interfered to help Trump win  Trump has denied that his campaign colluded with Russia  and described the Mueller probe as a political witch hunt  The newly released documents showed how the FBI made extensive use of its access to Cohen s Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  iCloud account  which allowed him to coordinate his work across such devices as an iPhone  iPad Mini and laptop  FBI agents said they located a hotel room in New York s Loews  NYSE L  Regency Hotel where Cohen was staying by using a device known as a Triggerfish that mimics cell phone towers to find a specific device  The bank fraud case stemmed from Cohen dealings unrelated to Trump  and suggest that his financial situation was dire  According to the documents  Cohen was in default by December 2017 on more than  20 million in loans backed by New York taxicab medallions he owned  The FBI believed Cohen misrepresented his finances to banks he owed money to  According to the documents  Cohen concealed fees being paid to Essential Consultants  a firm he controlled  for political consulting  including from international clients with issues pending before the Trump administration   Among the payments Cohen was believed to have received was  600 000 from AT T Inc  NYSE T  for consulting about  political issues  including net neutrality  the merger between AT T and Time Warner and tax reform   Another  583 333 came from an investment firm controlled by Russian businessman Viktor Vekselberg  the documents showed  Republicans in Congress have criticized Cohen s consulting work  arguing he should have made his contracts public through disclosures  The warrant does not appear to detail any violations to lobbying disclosure laws

SEOUL  Reuters    Samsung Electronics  KS 005930  Co Ltd said on Wednesday its new Galaxy flagship smartphones were selling well in China and it was confident it could reverse the recent slump in its fortunes in the world s biggest smartphone market 
Samsung s market share has plunged from about 20 percent in 2013 to less than 1 percent currently as fast growing Chinese rivals such as Huawei Technologies Co Ltd proved more agile in responding to the latest trends 
 It has been tough in China in the last two years  We have changed everything from our organization and people to distribution channels   Samsung Electronics Co Chief Executive DJ Koh told shareholders at the firm s annual general meeting 
 I think our flagship and mid price models  these two products will bring a lot of change to the China market     I am positive  
While Samsung remains the world s largest smartphone maker with nearly a fifth of global unit sales  it underperformed a slumping market last year and has closed one of its mobile phone manufacturing plants in China 
The South Korean tech giant is pinning its hopes for a fight back on its latest handset featuring a big  bending screen and the first 5G connection in a premium phone  a feature analysts do not expect Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL  to match until 2020 
FRUSTRATED SHAREHOLDERS
The upbeat outlook for mobile devices in China contrasts with the company s more pessimistic take on 2019  with trade tensions  weak economic growth and softer demand for memory chips expected to weigh on operations 
 We are expecting many difficulties this year such as slowing growth in major economies and risks over global trade conflicts   Co Chief Executive Kim Ki nam told the meeting 
Some shareholders vented their frustration and took the microphone to berate executives 
 If you re paid a lot of annual pay  you should work harder  I m asking the management to do good work   one shareholder told the board 
The meeting drew more than double the usual crowd following a stock split last year which made it easier for retail investors to own Samsung stock  There was a long queue around the Samsung building to get in  and some shareholders complained they were getting hungry as the meeting dragged on 
Samsung is seeking new growth in areas such as network equipment manufacturing as sales of its mainstay chips and smartphones begin to drop 

As expected  shareholders voted to approve the appointment of board directors ",47.09,47.25,46.48,46.63,126585600,-1

03-22-2019,By Makiko Yamazaki TOKYO  Reuters    When Japan Display Inc broke ground on a new factory in central Japan in 2015  the future looked bright for one of the world s top vendors of liquid crystal display  LCD  panels  The plant would strengthen the company s position as the primary screen supplier for Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL  as sales of the iPhone 6 soared  And the U S  smartphone juggernaut said it would front most of the  1 5 billion in costs  with Japan Display paying it back with a percentage of screen sales  according to two company sources  Four years later  Apple s shifting fortunes have brought Japan Display to its knees and threaten to end Japan s long run as a leader in display technology   A slowdown in iPhone sales  combined with a proliferation of new iPhone models   many of which use newer organic light emitting displays  OLED    have left Japan Display s new factory running at half capacity  But it still owes Apple a majority of the construction cost  one of the company sources said  He declined to give the exact amount   Desperate for capital  Japan Display is looking to an investor group  led by China Silkroad Investment Capital  for a bailout  two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said  The deal would give the Chinese group a near majority stake in exchange for an investment of  500 million to  700 million  the sources said  The group plans to build an OLED panel plant in China using Japan Display s technology  according to those two sources  The company s woes show how weak iPhone sales and a broader slowdown in the smartphone business are causing pain across the Asian electronics supply chain   In retrospect  the new plant was unnecessary   one of the sources with direct knowledge of the bailout talks said   But the decision wasn t wrong back then  Japan Display started to pick up steam thanks to Apple at the time  and Apple wanted the new plant   Japan Display wasn t alone in betting on robust growth in iPhone sales  which looked especially attractive because of Apple s now abandoned strategy of offering few variations in each product cycle   We were all thrilled to see lifetime sales of a single iPhone model reaching 100 million units   a source at another Apple parts supplier said   Supplying components for just one model in massive volume is extremely cost efficient   he said   At the same time  we exposed ourselves to huge volatility risks   Japan Display has built relationships with other smartphone vendors  including Chinese powerhouses Huawei  Xiaomi  and OPPO   But it is losing their orders too as sales growth softens and the Chinese players switch to domestic panel makers such as BOE Technology and Tianma Microelectronics  which have sharply improved the quality of their screens  Japan Display supplied almost a third of Huawei s smartphone screens in 2015  but its share had plunged to 4 percent by the third quarter last year as the Chinese company turned to BOE and Tianma  according to researcher IHS Markit   Sources at Japan Display and other Apple suppliers interviewed for the story declined to be identified as they are not authorised to talk to the media  Suppliers rarely speak about business with Apple on the record because of strict non disclosure agreements  NON APPLE BUSINESSES Japan Display was formed in 2012 in a government backed merger of the ailing display units of Sony Corp  T 6758   Toshiba Corp and Hitachi Ltd  It boasts strength in so called thin film transistor technology  TFT   crucial for making high resolution images on both LCD and OLED panels  In addition to its Apple business  which accounted for more than half the company s revenue over the last four years  it s a top supplier of dashboard panels for major automotive component companies such as Continental  But Japan Display has struggled to navigate the fast changing display business  Its new LCD factory was still under construction when Apple informed Japan Display in autumn 2015 that it planned to move quickly away from LCD to the newer OLED technology  two former company officials said  It was too costly by then to abandon the half completed plant  one of them said  Japan Display s management at the time  led by former Sanyo Electric executive Mitsuru Homma  promised to start mass production of OLED panels by 2018  In the meantime  the management shut down older  unprofitable LCD lines to shift resources to OLED  but its main investor  a state backed fund  blocked plans for drastic job cuts for fear of public backlash  one of the former officials said  Unexpectedly weak sales of the iPhone 6s created a cash crunch in 2016  and Homma resigned early the next year after the company took a  640 million bailout from the state backed fund  The new chief executive  Nobuhiro Higashiiriki  declared a full on shift to OLED  But the company was already behind rivals  notably Samsung Electronics  KS 005930   and still needed more cash for OLED investment  Disappointing sales of the iPhone XR  the only LCD model in Apple s 2018 lineup  were yet another blow   The company now looks exhausted  with many engineers leaving   one former employee said  Some board members have expressed concerns about technology transfer that may follow the proposed Chinese investment  sources familiar with the talks said  But the government investment fund has run out of patience   We don t have any other option   one of the company sources said  adding that the government has been quiet about the bailout plan   They could argue that display technologies are not something Japan must keep and protect  when Chinese panel makers are ramping up more display plants  ,48.83,49.42,47.69,47.76,169630800,-1
03-22-2019,"By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK  Reuters    Shake ups come infrequently for the Dow Jones Industrial Average  but some degree of change may be in the works for the stock index as two of its 30 constituents prepare to transform from large conglomerates into smaller companies  The latest occasion to re examine the Dow stems from chemical company DowDuPont Inc  which is breaking up into three publicly listed stocks  The first step  the separation of the company s Dow materials science division  is due to take effect on April 1  Another index component  industrial conglomerate United Technologies Corp  NYSE UTX   is also in the process of separating into three companies  possibly in about a year  While many professional investors prefer other stock gauges to the Dow  membership in the blue chip index   often thought of as Main Street s market barometer   still carries allure because of its relatively few constituents  Funds with billions of dollars under management are also linked to the index  so constituent changes affect flows into and out of stocks  While pieces of the original components could stay in the Dow  those corporate actions could spur the overseers of the index to add fresh blood  some market watchers say   All of the options are certainty on the table   said Todd Rosenbluth  head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA   This could be a catalyst for a new addition to the broader index   S P Dow Jones Indices  which publishes the Dow index  will make an announcement before April 1  according to spokesman Ray McConville  Any time there is a corporate action in an index  McConville said   S P DJI will review the index and make any necessary changes and issue a public announcement before the transaction takes place   Known for its inclusion of large U S  companies as well as its relatively few members compared to other barometers  the Dow has changed components roughly every two years over the past 20 years  The most recent such move came last June  when longtime member  General Electric   NYSE GE  Co was replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance  NASDAQ WBA  Inc   Prior to that  DowDupont took over for DuPont  NYSE DWDP  in September 2017  after the latter company merged with  Dow Chemical   NYSE DOW   and Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  replaced AT T  NYSE T  in March 2015  The index is a measure of 30 companies designed to provide suitable sector representation  except for transportation and utilities stocks  which are covered by other Dow Jones indexes  according to published methodology for the index  The overall level of the Dow does not change when its components do  because the divisor used to calculate the index is adjusted  Stock selection is  not governed by  quantitative rules  according to the published methodology  which also says  a stock typically is added only if the company has an excellent reputation  demonstrates sustained growth and is of interest to a large number of investors    The subjectivity of the criteria regularly prompts speculation about which companies may qualify  Some companies that seem like obvious candidates at first blush may have strikes against them  For example  two of the largest U S  companies   Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN  and Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  Inc  the parent of Google   have share prices that are both well over  1 000 each   That s a problem because such high prices would warp the Dow  whose constituents carry more weight the higher their share price  At about  375 a share  Boeing  NYSE BA  Co is the highest priced stock in the Dow by more than  100  Many indexes  such as the S P 500  are weighted by companies  market capitalization  rather than by their share price  One remaining piece of DowDuPont   the only materials sector stock in the Dow   could stay in the Dow Jones index    If you take DowDuPont off  then there is nothing really with that materials  exposure  said James Ragan  director of wealth management research at D A  Davidson in Seattle   I am not sure this is an opportunity to make a big change here   The DowDuPont breakup will leave Dow  specialty products company DuPont and Corteva  which focuses on agriculture  Dow and DuPont would be the biggest of the three  with market values estimated at about  50 billion and  60 billion  respectively  according to Nomura Instinet analyst Aleksey Yefremov   If they want to have a materials company they have to pick one of these two  just because they are so broad   Yefremov said   United Tech  is separating into an aerospace supplier  an elevator manufacturer  and a provider of building products including air conditioning systems   Aerospace is by far the biggest division of the three by sales  but with one aerospace stock already in the Dow   planemaker Boeing   that new company may be redundant  In many investors  eyes  the Dow pales in importance as a market barometer to the S P 500  with its 500 constituents weighted by market value  Just over  23 billion is invested in mutual and exchange traded funds tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average compared to nearly  4 3 trillion tied to the S P 500  according to Lipper research  But the more than 120 year old index remains a popular market gauge   The Dow s price weighted construct and the fact that it s only 30 names makes it reasonably distinct from measures that folks will more likely look at to be representing the

Myer has 61 stores  mostly across the eastern part of the country  Stores are usually in areas of high foot traffic in major metropolitan shopping centers as well as in city centers ",48.83,49.42,47.69,47.76,169630800,1
03-22-2019," Bloomberg     Donald Trump said he s nominating Stephen Moore  a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation and a long time supporter of the president  for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board 
Trump made the announcement Friday to reporters traveling with him to Palm Beach  Florida  confirming an earlier Bloomberg News report 
Moore has emerged as an ardent critic of the Federal Reserve Board under its current chairman  Jerome Powell  who fell out of favor with Trump last year after the Fed s rate increases  Placing him on the board may be the president s attempt to check Powell and head off further tightening of U S  monetary policy that Trump believes could slow economic growth before his 2020 re election campaign 
Moore blamed the Fed for slowing the economy while championing Trump s policies in a March 13 Journal column that he co authored  Trump s chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow showed the op ed to Trump after it was published  according to two people familiar with the matter  Moore also suggested the Fed stabilize the value of the dollar by adopting a commodity price rule 
 I believe the people on the Federal Reserve Board should be thrown out for economic malpractice   Moore said Dec  22 on Red Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  Group chairman and chief executive John Catsimatidis s radio show  blaming an end of the year stock market swoon on the Fed s rate hikes 
 Janet Yellen couldn t have been any worse than the guy he s got in there now   Moore said of Powell   I always thought he was a bad choice  He s been a Fed guy for many years  Donald Trump wanted to drain the swamp  The Fed is the swamp  
Moore is a former adviser on Trump s campaign who helped write its economic agenda and a close Kudlow friend  He was a senior economist on the Congressional Joint Economic Committee  served on the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal and was an economic analyst for CNN 
Also under consideration for the board is Herman Cain  the former pizza company executive who ran for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination  according to the people  who asked not to be identified discussing Trump s private deliberations 
There are two vacant seats on the Fed board 
Bloomberg News previously reported that Cain  73  was under consideration  Yet his nomination would raise the prospect of a Senate confirmation hearing focused on the sexual harassment accusations that ended his presidential campaign  While he remains in the running  there are concerns in the White House about whether he could clear the confirmation process  according to a person familiar with the matter 
Cain last September co founded a pro Trump super political action committee  America Fighting Back PAC  which features a photo of the president on its website and says   We must protect Donald Trump and his agenda from impeachment  
He has had a long corporate career  and from 1992 to 1996 he served as a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  as well as deputy chairman and later chairman  He advocated for the U S  to return to the gold standard during his presidential campaign and as recently as December 2017 defended higher interest rates  a position that contrasts with Trump s repeated criticisms of the Fed last year ",48.83,49.42,47.69,47.76,169630800,1

03-22-2019,"By Josh Horwitz SHANGHAI  Reuters    Smartphone retailers in China say it s a tough sell of late with consumers reluctant to upgrade  put off by chill economic winds  Even so domestic brands led by Huawei have made big strides  wooing consumers with top notch hardware and innovative features as they move upmarket in the  500  800 price range  The result  a loss of share in a key segment for Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL  and fresh price cuts for iPhones by Chinese retailers   Of those people who are upgrading  there are many switching from Apple to Chinese brands but very few switching from Chinese brands to Apple   said Jiang Ning  who manages a Xiaomi store in the northern province of Shandong  Huawei Technologies Co Ltd  Xiaomi Corp  Oppo and Vivo once sought to grab share in the world s biggest smartphone market with value for money devices  but consumer demand for better phones has prompted strategic rethinks    People are more attached to their phone than ever and have higher expectations for the function and experience it offers  The response has been constant upgrading of hardware specs   Alen Wu  global vice president at Oppo  told Reuters  He Fan  CEO of Huishoubao which buys and resells used phones  said he has seen a consumer shift to Huawei from Apple  driven by the Chinese love of selfies and emphasis on camera quality  Huawei has had a tie up with German camera maker Leica since 2016    Huawei s cameras have become noticeably better than Apple s in that they suit the tastes of Chinese consumers more   he said   Compared to dual cameras common in most smartphones  Huawei s P20 Pro device boasts three rear facing cameras  with the additional one improving zoom capabilities   It is one of several new devices in its P20 and Mate 20 lines  which helped Huawei s share of the  500  800 segment in China surge to 26 6 percent last year from 8 8 percent  data from research firm Counterpoint shows  Apple  by contrast  saw its share of the segment tumble to 54 6 percent from 81 2 percent  also hurt by its decision to move even further upmarket with the iPhone X series   Most Chinese smartphone buyers are not ready to shell out beyond  1 000 for a phone   said Neil Shah  research director at Counterpoint   This left a gap in the below  800 segment  which Chinese vendors grabbed with both hands    For a graphic on  Chinese smartphones increase share of home market  click   Shipments of phones priced above  600 in China grew 10 percent in 2018  data from research firm Canalys shows  By contrast  the overall market shrunk 14 percent  marking a second year of contraction  OVERSEAS GAINS The weaker cachet for Apple in China was underscored this month when several major retailers simultaneously cut iPhone prices for a second time this year  A 64GB iPhone 8 sold at Suning com Co Ltd now costs 3 899 yuan   580   roughly 25 percent less than it did in December  That s also lower than its  599 price tag in the United States  where iPhones typically cost less to buy than in China  Most iPhone models through to the iPhone 8 series have seen prices in China cut  albeit not equally  In earnings too  it seems to be a tale of divergent fortunes  Apple s October December revenue from the Greater China region fell by about a quarter from a year earlier  Greater China currently accounts for 15 6 percent of its overall revenue  Huawei  the world s No  2 smartphone maker  has estimated revenue for 2018 rose 21 percent  which analysts attribute in large part to robust smartphone sales  More broadly  fewer sales for Apple means fewer customers for its App Store and media streaming services  The shift to higher end phones by Chinese brands has also meant greater inroads in overseas markets  Huawei s shipments in Europe jumped 55 percent in the latest quarter and it now has 23 6 percent market share  according to Canalys  That s not far behind Samsung Electronics  KS 005930  and Apple which saw small declines in shipments  OPPO  VIVO  If Huawei is taking the lion s share of turf that Apple once had in China  Oppo and Vivo   brands owned by electronics hardware conglomerate BBK   are the newest threats  In June  Vivo launched the Nex which starts from 3 898 yuan   610  and in July  Oppo launched the Find X  priced at 4 999 yuan   755    The models mark the first time the brands have priced a phone above  600  a sharp departure from their roots selling  300  500 models to young consumers in second tier cities  The devices came with features unavailable in the iPhone  including under the glass fingerprint sensors and  notchless  displays  both of which increase the size of usable screen  Xiaomi too is going upmarket  announcing in January it would split off its low budget Redmi range of phones into a sub brand  In doing so  it is taking a leaf out of Huawei s book which has for years sold cheaper devices under the Honor brand  helping differentiate its products  Redmi will target international markets and e commerce sales  while the flagship Xiaomi brand will target China and offline retail markets  company founder Lei Jun told reporters  Last month  Xiaomi unveiled the Mi 9  its latest flagship device with a price tag of 2 999 yuan   450   But the company also said it might be the last time a Xiaomi flagship phone would be priced under 3 000 yuan    Xiaomi s flagship series phones were once always set at 1 999 yuan   said Lei   This was a contributing factor to our rise  but it also became an obstacle to our growth   he said

03-25-2019,"Investing com   Wall Street pressed lower on Monday as concerns over the economic outlook outweighed positive market developments and risk aversion dominated 
The fact that the spread on U S  bond yields relaxed their inversion on Monday  after inverting for the first time since prior to the financial crisis  positive economic data out of Germany and relief over political developments stateside were unable to prevent an extension of the panic that triggered the S P 500 s worst day since January at the end of last week 
At 10 00 AM ET  14 00 GMT   the Dow Jones fell 98 points  or 0 4  to 25 404 49 points  the S P 500 lost 11 points  or 0 4   to 2 789 72 while the Nasdaq Composite traded down 41 points  or 0 5   to 7 601 81 points 
Investors were still jittery after the U S  yield curve inverted on Friday for the first time since 2007  The yield on the 10 year Treasury fell below the 3 month T bill rate  an event that some analysts consider to foreshadow a recession  though that is not always the case  In normal conditions  a longer term bond should carry a higher yield than a short term one as there is a higher risk for a longer time period 
However  Rob Carnell  economist at ING  warned against reaching too quick a conclusion 
 We suspect that drawing a recession conclusion from such data is not warranted until the 3M 10Y yield curve is inverted by a substantial amount   Carnell said   Just inverted     doesn t do it for me  
Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans also downplayed the yield curve inversion  given his confidence in the U S  economic outlook 
 Some of this is structural  having to do with lower trend growth  lower real interest rates   he said Monday at the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference in Hong Kong   I think  in that environment  it s probably more natural that yield curves are somewhat flatter than they have been historically  
Former Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen also said on Monday that the yield curve may signal the need to cut interest rates at some point  but it does not signal a recession 
But risk averse investors found little consolation in the fact that the yield curve returned to its normal shape on Monday  with the rate on the 3 month Treasury bill moving back below that of the benchmark 10 year note 
In a day with no major U S  economic reports  German data had provided positive signs as business confidence in the euro zone s largest economy rebounded more than expected  posting its first improvement after six months of declines 
Also reducing tensions  Special Counsel Robert Mueller found no evidence of collusion between U S  President Donald Trump s campaign team and Russia  and did not present enough evidence to warrant charging the president with obstruction of justice  U S  Attorney General William Barr said on Sunday 
The end to the investigation that Trump always referred to as a  witch hunt  not only could serve as a potential tool for his reelection campaign  but removes what some see as a distraction from pressing economic questions such as infrastructure spending or trade relations with China 
 Now is the time to get back on the offense on the economy and growth   said Republican strategist Scott Reed

03-25-2019,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Monday  March 25 
1  U S  Treasury Yield Curve Turns Positive
After inverting on Friday for the first time in more than a decade  the spread between the yield on the 3 month Treasury bill and the 10 year note turned positive 
The inverted yield curve is widely considered to be a leading indicator of recession  especially when it stays for an extended period of time 
At around 5 50 AM ET  10 50 GMT   the yield on the benchmark 10 year Treasury note inched higher to around 2 46   after going as low as 2 42  on Friday 
Meanwhile  the yield on the 3 month Treasury bond dipped to 2 45  



Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans said earlier it was understandable for markets to be nervous when the yield curve flattened  though he was still confident about the U S  economic outlook 
2  Wall Street Set for Lower Open
U S  stock index futures pointed to a lower open to start the week  as growing fears of a U S  recession dampened appetite for riskier assets 
The blue chip Dow futures were down 47 points  or about 0 2   the S P 500 futures shed 6 points  or around 0 2   while the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a decline of 34 points  or roughly 0 5  
Elsewhere  European stocks edged lower in mid morning trade  with most sectors and major bourses across the region in negative territory  as investors kept tabs on Brexit developments 
Earlier  markets in Asia tumbled  with Japan s Nikkei dropping 3   Shares in mainland China also fell sharply  with the Shanghai Composite down 2  
3  Mueller Report Clears Trump of Conspiring with Russia
Special Counsel Robert Mueller found no evidence of collusion between President Donald Trump s campaign team and Russia  and did not present enough evidence to warrant charging Trump with obstruction of justice  U S  Attorney General William Barr said on Sunday 
Trump quickly hailed the announcement as  complete and total exoneration  after nearly two years of investigation by Mueller and his team 
His opponents in Congress called for the full report to be released  rather than just Barr s summary of it 
4  German Ifo Rebounds
German business morale improved unexpectedly in March after six consecutive drops  a survey showed  suggesting that Europe s largest economy is likely to pick up in the coming months after it narrowly avoided a recession last year 
The Munich based Ifo economic institute said its business climate index  based on a monthly survey of companies  edged forward to 99 6 this month from 98 5  February s reading had been the lowest level since November 2014  The reading beat economists  expectations for 98 7 
The improvement was due overwhelmingly to responses from the domestic focused retail and construction sectors  The manufacturing sector  which is more exposed to trends in global demand  stayed gloomy 
5  Apple s  Show Time  Event
Apple is widely expected to announce a streaming video service and a news subscription at a launch event later Monday 
 It s show time  is how the iPhone maker billed the affair slated for the Steve Jobs Theater at its Cupertino  California  headquarters at 1 00PM ET  17 00 GMT  
According to reports  Apple will offer subscriptions to channels such as HBO  Showtime and Starz for  9 99 a month each 
Reports have also indicated that the company plans to sell an updated Apple News offering  which would aggregate news and magazine subscriptions into one product  for  9 99 a month 
Bolstering services revenue is a big part of Apple s strategy for future growth  given that revenue from sales of its iPhones is plateauing 
Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  shares  which closed down about 2  on Friday at  191 05  were little changed in pre market trade

03-25-2019,"Investing com   Wall Street is set for a lower open on Monday as fears of slowing growth and a possible U S  recession lead investors to shun risk assets 
But positive economic data out of Germany and relief over political developments stateside helped to calm the nerves that triggered the S P 500 s worst day since January at the end of last week 
The blue chip Dow futures fell 12 points  or 0 1   to 25 558 5 points by 6 46 AM ET  11 46 GMT   the S P 500 futures lost 2 points  or 0 1   to 2 808 88 points  while the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures traded down 24 points  or 0 3   to 7 345 25 points 
Investors were still jittery after the U S  yield curve inverted on Friday for the first time since 2007  The yield on the 10 year Treasury fell below the 3 month T bill rate  an event that some analysts consider to foreshadow a recession  though that is not always the case  In normal conditions  a longer term bond should carry a higher yield than a short term one as there is a higher risk for a longer time period 
However  Rob Carnell  economist at ING  warned against reaching too quick a conclusion   We suspect that drawing a recession conclusion from such data is not warranted until the 3M 10Y yield curve is inverted by a substantial amount   Carnell said   Just inverted  as today s markets indicate  doesn t do it for me  
Chicago Federal Reserve Bank president Charles Evans also downplayed the yield curve inversion  given his confidence in the U S  economic outlook 
 Some of this is structural  having to do with lower trend growth  lower real interest rates   he said Monday at the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference in Hong Kong   I think  in that environment  it s probably more natural that yield curves are somewhat flatter than they have been historically  
Former Fed chair Janet Yellen also said on Monday that the yield curve may signal the need to cut interest rates at some point  but it does not signal a recession 
In a day with no major U S  economic reports  German data helped traders breathe a sigh of relief as business confidence rebounded more than expected  posting its first improvement after six months of declines 
The yield curve also returned to its normal shape with the rate on the 3 month Treasury bill at 2 45  by 6 47 AM ET  11 47 GMT  while the benchmark 10 year note moved higher to 2 47  
Also providing relief  Special Counsel Robert Mueller found no evidence of collusion between President Donald Trump s campaign team and Russia  and did not present enough evidence to warrant charging the president with obstruction of justice  U S  Attorney General William Barr said on Sunday 
The end to the investigation removes what some see as a distraction from pressing economic questions such as infrastructure spending or trade relations with China

04-01-2019,"By Paresh Dave SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    On stage at an investor conference last month  Google s Chief Business Officer Philipp Schindler identified a vexing challenge for the company s most prized app  its virtual assistant   Responding to user searches out loud through Google Assistant is not ideal for generating revenue  Schindler suggested   When results are visible  not merely oral   you have room for advertising  of course   said Schindler  whose company grosses an estimated  70 billion annually through ads above search results   The Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  Inc company declined to elaborate on Schindler s remarks  But Google s conundrum is one facing several big tech companies whose users increasingly seek help from voice enabled speakers and gadgets  how to deliver greater convenience while still generating the ad revenue that traditionally has funded free searches  The question is most acute for Google  which holds the world s biggest search advertising business   So far  consumers generally get a brief answer from virtual assistants without the disturbance of ads  And tech companies have not shown how they would include the  Sponsored  or  Ad  disclaimers that regulators in the United States and elsewhere require with paid for search results  One Google Assistant feature already is close to violating disclosure rules  according to five advertising attorneys contacted by Reuters  Google contends it is in compliance  The feature recommends plumbers and other local home service providers without disclosing that the results draw from a curated database mainly composed of companies that joined a Google marketing program    It s not a completely clean recommendation   said Michelle Cohen  an attorney with expertise in marketing rules at Ifrah Law in Washington  D C   If there s a financial commitment  you re supposed to disclose it   Conversing with assistants is routine for millions of people globally  whether on bedside alarm clocks  car audio systems or even high end headphones  More than 1 billion such devices have Google Assistant  100 million Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  Inc s Alexa and at least 1 billion Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  Inc s Siri  according to the companies and estimates  Regulators avoid stifling new technologies  said Richard Lawson  partner at Manatt  Phelps   Phillips and former consumer protection director in Florida s attorney general s office  But he said  authorities will still ask   How do you convey meaningful disclosures   At the conference  Schindler said ads on Google Assistant would be more  interesting  when responses are shown on a nearby screen  like a TV  smartphone  laptop or smart speaker with a display   Then we re exactly in the world that we deeply understand   Schindler said  with moneymaking options  very similar  to traditional search  NEW SEARCH TECHNOLOGIES The Federal Trade Commission  which regulates deceptive business practices in the United States  has long required search engines to inform users in a  noticeable and understandable  fashion when results are connected to financial relationships  That is why consumers see  Ad  or  Sponsored  labels next to the first few Google results on screens  New search services that  talk  to consumers are not exempt from  the long standing principle of making advertising distinguishable   the FTC said in letters to Google and other companies in 2013   Consumers often complain to the commission about potential violations  and it prods companies into changing practices by threatening fines if the issues persist   The FTC has not received complaints about ads on Google Assistant  according to results from a Freedom of Information Act request  And the agency declined to comment on whether it is scrutinizing any virtual assistants  though last year it charged a small search engine for prospective college students that included paid results without warning  GOOGLE S CHALLENGE Google users have come to expect results from any relevant source on the web  except when using specialized tools like Google News or Google Flights that have a narrowed set of sources  In 2017  Google Assistant adopted a specialty tool  Local Services  which offers only vetted businesses when U S  users search for domestic help such as plumbers and locksmiths  Results come from a marketing program  known as Google Guarantee  in which members are licensed  insured and clear of legal issues  according to Google  It refunds consumers up to  2 000 if members botch a job  Membership is free  but businesses need it to buy Local Services search ads from Google  And guaranteed businesses largely do buy those for queries like  plumber   Reuters found  Google gets paid when users contact providers through the ads  which are labeled  Sponsored  on Google com  But when Google Assistant responds to  plumber  queries with the same  Google Guaranteed  options  the assistant does not offer any disclaimer or further explanation  Google said in a statement that the results are not labeled as ads  because Google isn t paid for these results  when delivered on the Assistant rather than Google com  The advertising attorneys said users should be informed that Google Assistant results  even if not paid for  stem from a filtered database in which many businesses landed because they wanted to buy ads   Disclosing  many of the recommended providers may participate in our referral network    would be relevant and appropriate   said Cohen  the Washington  D C   attorney  In some cities  Google Assistant includes businesses vetted by partner search services HomeAdvisor and Porch  It does not mention that those services charge some businesses for customer leads  Disclaimers vary in other types of searches  depending on how they are delivered  Google com answers  flight to Los Angeles  with upcoming flights labeled as  Sponsored   and users who click on the label would learn that Google  may be compensated  by some of its data sources  But Google Assistant s  Sponsored  label does not link to additional information  On smart speakers  the assistant reads only the lowest price without naming an airline   
It says nothing about sponsors ",47.46,47.52,47.13,47.49,234428400,1
04-01-2019,By Joel Schectman and Christopher Bing WASHINGTON  Reuters    A group of American hackers who once worked for U S  intelligence agencies helped the United Arab Emirates spy on a BBC host  the chairman of Al Jazeera and other prominent Arab media figures during a tense 2017 confrontation pitting the UAE and its allies against the Gulf state of Qatar  The American operatives worked for Project Raven  a secret Emirati intelligence program that spied on dissidents  militants and political opponents of the UAE monarchy  A Reuters investigation in January revealed Project Raven s existence and inner workings  including the fact that it surveilled a British activist and several unnamed U S  journalists  The Raven operatives   who included at least nine former employees of the U S  National Security Agency and the U S  military   found themselves thrust into the thick of a high stakes dispute among America s Gulf allies  The Americans  role in the UAE Qatar imbroglio highlights how former U S  intelligence officials have become key players in the cyber wars of other nations  with little oversight from Washington  The crisis erupted in the spring of 2017  when the UAE and allies   including Saudi Arabia and Egypt   accused Qatar of sowing unrest in the Middle East through its support of media outlets and political groups  The UAE camp demanded Qatar take a series of actions  including shuttering the Qatar funded Al Jazeera satellite television network  withdrawing funding from other media outlets Doha supports  and cracking down on the Muslim Brotherhood  an Islamic movement some Arab governments regard as a threat  In June 2017  the UAE camp severed diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed an air  land and sea blockade against the tiny nation  It was an unprecedented confrontation among Arab countries that had historically prized consensus  That week  Project Raven operatives sprang into action  launching operations to break into the Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  iPhones of at least 10 journalists and media executives they believed had connections to the Qatari government or the Muslim Brotherhood  according to program documents reviewed by Reuters and four people involved in the activities  Raven targeted Arab media figures who spanned a range of political thought   from a Beirut based BBC host to the chairman of Al Jazeera and a producer from a London satellite channel founded by a member of the Muslim Brotherhood  The goal  the former Raven operatives said  was to find material showing that Qatar s royal family had influenced the coverage of Al Jazeera and other media outlets  and uncover any ties between the influential TV network and the Muslim Brotherhood  Reuters couldn t determine what data Raven obtained  Al Jazeera has long maintained it is independent from Qatar s government  Jassim Bin Mansour Al Thani  a media attach  for Qatar s embassy in Washington  said  the government of Qatar does not request  ask  or enforce on Al Jazeera any agenda whatsoever   Al Jazeera  is treated like any other respected media outlet   The UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment  The NSA declined to comment  A Department of Defense spokeswoman declined to comment  Dana Shell  LON RDSa  Smith  the former U S  ambassador to Qatar  said she found it alarming that American intelligence veterans were able to work for another government in targeting an American ally  She said Washington should better supervise U S  government trained hackers after they leave the intelligence community   Folks with these skill sets should not be able to knowingly or unknowingly undermine U S  interests or contradict U S  values   Smith told Reuters  Among the Arab journalists hacked  Raven project documents show  was Giselle Khoury  Beirut based host of BBC Arabic s  The Scene   a program that interviews Middle Eastern leaders on current events  Three days after the blockade began  Raven operatives hacked her iPhone  Raven program documents show she was targeted because of her contact with Azmi Bishara  a Doha based writer who has been critical of the UAE and founded the news outlet Al Araby Al Jadeed   They need to spend their time on making better their country  their economy   Khoury said in an interview after Reuters informed her of the hack   Not on having Giselle Khoury as a hacking target   On June 19  2017  Americans working for Raven targeted Faisal al Qassem  host of a popular Al Jazeera show called  The Opposite Direction   interviews and documents show  The show features guests who heatedly debate controversial topics such as corruption in Middle Eastern governments  Informed by Reuters about his hacking  al Qassem said he was not surprised he was targeted by the UAE  which he accuses of being  a symbol of corruption and dirty politics    In a word  they are afraid of the truth   he said  That same day  Raven operatives targeted the iPhone of Al Jazeera s chairman  Hamad bin Thamer bin Mohammed Al Thani  Through an Al Jazeera spokesman  Al Thani declined to comment  The attacks utilized a cyber weapon called Karma  As Reuters reported in January  Karma allowed Raven operatives to remotely hack into iPhones by inputting a target s phone number or associated email address into the attack software  Unlike many exploits  Karma did not require a target to click on a link sent to an iPhone  they said  Apple declined to comment  Karma provided Raven operatives access to the contacts  messages  photos and other data stored on iPhones  It did not allow them to monitor phone calls  While Raven operatives broke into the devices  they did not have full access to the data they collected  they passed the material on to UAE intelligence officials overseeing the operation  It s unclear what they found  In January  UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash was asked by reporters in New York about Project Raven after the initial Reuters report  Gargash acknowledged his country has a  cyber capability  but didn t specifically address the program  He denied targeting U S  citizens or countries with which the UAE has good relations  SPYING EFFORT S U S  LINKS The UAE created Project Raven in 2009 with the help of American intelligence contractors and former senior White House officials from the George W  Bush administration  The U S  National Security Council declined to comment on Project Raven  At first  the goal was to crack down on terrorism by helping the UAE monitor militants around the region  But Raven s mission quickly expanded to include monitoring and suppressing a range of UAE political opponents  the documents show  Among its targets was Qatar  which the UAE and Saudi Arabia had long accused of fueling political opposition across the region  in part through the Qatari government s funding of Al Jazeera  During the Arab Spring protests of 2011  Gulf countries viewed Al Jazeera s expansive coverage of street demonstrations as a deliberate attempt by Qatar to fuel opposition to their monarchs   It was seen as a tool to foment popular unrest   said Elisa Catalano Ewers  a former advisor on the region for President Obama s National Security Council  Al Jazeera s protest coverage  had a huge psychological impact  for demonstrators  said Moncef Marzouki  the former president of Tunisia  who was elected in 2011 after Arab Spring demonstrations ousted long time ruler Zine al Abidine Ben Ali  The broadcasts sent a message to protesters that  this battle is happening everywhere  you are not alone   Al Qassem  the host hacked by Raven  said Al Jazeera presents all sides  without censorship   The street and the Arab people can decide what s right   he said  Wary of the Muslim Brotherhood s growing influence in the region after the 2011 protests  UAE authorities launched a crackdown on dozens of suspected Islamists  many of whom have been convicted of planning to overthrow the government  In 2014  the UAE formally designated the Brotherhood and local affiliates as terrorist groups  The Emiratis also tapped Raven in the effort to contain dissent at home  according to former Raven operatives and project documents  In the years after the Arab Spring  the operatives were increasingly tasked with targeting human rights activists and journalists who questioned the government  TARGETING JOURNALISTS In June 2017  after Gulf nations began their blockade of Qatar  the UAE ramped up efforts to spy on journalists seen as tied to Qatar  That month  Project Raven s Qatar mission expanded from two full time operatives assigned to the country to seven  On June 20  Raven operatives hacked into the iPhone of Abdullah Al Athba  chief editor of Qatar s oldest newspaper  Al Arab  program documents show  In an interview with Reuters  Al Athba said he believed he was targeted  because I am a supporter of the Arab Spring since the beginning   who repeatedly criticized the Emiratis for their opposition to the movement  The Raven effort went beyond the Middle East  Operatives used Karma to target the mobile phones of other media figures the UAE believed were being supported by Qatar  including journalists for London based Arabic media outlets Al Araby TV and Al Hiwar  Both networks televise Arabic language channels popular in the Middle East  Al Thani  the Qatari spokesman  said the government does not support Al Araby TV  Al Hiwar or Al Arab  The satellite channel Al Araby TV and its namesake website are units of London based Fadaat Media Ltd  owned and supported by Qatari businessmen  The outlet sees itself as the voice of  secular  liberal  pro democracy  Arabs  said Abdulrahman Elshayyal  director of Al Araby TV  He and two other Araby employees were hacked in the weeks following the start of the blockade  Raven documents show   It s a very worrying trend that a state is using all these things to spy on people critical of them   Elshayyal said in a phone interview   I m not a terrorist or a money launderer   Bishara  the founder of Al Araby Al Jadeed  was also targeted by Raven  He told Reuters he regards his outlet as  relatively independent  in the context of the Arab world   Nobody tells us what to say   said Bishara  a Palestinian Christian who lives in Qatar  though  sometimes the newspaper might be sensitive about what not to say  because you are not there to provoke the people that finance you   Al Hiwar  another London based Arabic satellite channel  was targeted by Raven on the day the blockade began  Al Hiwar founder Azzam Tamimi said he believes the UAE was fearful of his channel s support for political reform and democratization in the Arab world  Unlike others caught in the crosshairs of Project Raven  though  Al Hiwar doesn t deny being sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood  which the outlet supports  because they are the victims   he said  Tamimi told Reuters he is a longtime Muslim Brotherhood member and a supporter of the Palestinian militant group Hamas  Tamimi declined to say whether the channel received money from the Qatari government but said he ll accept any support  provided there s no strings attached  He said the channel gives voice to a range of opinions and encourages dialogue  But there are

04-09-2019,By Chris Taylor NEW YORK  Reuters    When college student Danny Franklin started thinking about jobs after graduation  his expectations were not very high  The 21 year old accounting major at Delaware State had the typical work experience of many young Americans  Not a whole lot   Franklin s job history included stints at McDonald s  Sears  and Sam s Club   but nothing that would really grab the attention of a big accounting firm  No wonder Franklin s LinkedIn  NYSE LNKD  page did not generate any job leads  Then his adviser in junior year told him about Handshake  joinhandshake com   a jobs community for college kids and young alumni  After a month or two of building his Handshake profile  he was taken aback  Companies were starting to contact him  instead of the other way around   I was very surprised and overwhelmed   says Franklin   Companies were telling me about internships  professional development events and inviting me to apply to all these things   Among the big name firms that got in touch were consumer products giant Procter   Gamble  and a couple of the nation s largest accounting concerns  Deloitte and PwC   Franklin ended up accepting a position with prominent investment managers Capital Group  in its Norfolk  Virginia  offices  He is slated to start a full time position there in the fall  after his graduation this spring  CULTIVATING EXPERIENCE Franklin managed to solve a tricky puzzle young grads encounter when entering the workforce  How do you get that first job in your chosen field  when you do not have any experience yet   LinkedIn is more of a mid career tool  when you already have work experience and your professional network is established   says Garrett Lord  Handshake s CEO and co founder   But many students don t have that work experience yet and may not even know what they want  That s where Handshake shines   After all  it is not easy for young adults to get on that first rung of the corporate ladder  even in a hot economy  In fact  41 4 percent of recent grads are considered  underemployed   or working in a lower level gig that did not require a degree  according to a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York  It is an easier leap to make for students at big name universities   like  say  Harvard or Yale   since Fortune 500 companies will physically come to their campuses and job fairs and actively recruit  But for students at smaller colleges that may not be on recruiters  radars  like Danny Franklin at Delaware State  how are they supposed to get started in life  It was a familiar problem for Garrett Lord  himself a graduate of Michigan Tech  which was not exactly the first stop on the trail for Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  or Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  recruiters  That is why he and his co founders started Handshake  to create something akin to LinkedIn  but focused on college kids and young grads across the country and not just those in the Ivy League  Handshake s numbers so far are impressive  14 million college students and young alumni  more than 700 colleges in its network  900 000 recruiters   and  notably  100 percent of the Fortune 500  It has obviously caught the attention of significant Silicon Valley movers  with backers like the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative  yes  that Zuckerberg   the Omidyar Network  that s Pierre Omidyar  founder of eBay  NASDAQ EBAY    venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins  and more  It is certainly a sea change from the college jobs offices of yore  Those of us of a certain age remember dusty and disorganized operations  with harried supervisors  cluttered desks and index cards of random job offers tacked up on corkboards  By and large  job hunting at colleges does not work like that anymore  In fact  Handshake has partnered with 70 percent of the top 500 universities in the country  matching them with 350 000 companies trying to fill slots  Of course  students do not necessarily need to choose between career apps  They can leverage all of them and boost their odds of getting HR managers  attention   When Danny Franklin racked up an impressive 3 5 GPA  joined his school s accounting club and put in some volunteer work with Habitat for Humanity  he uploaded it all   and  apparently  it paid off    Without that profile  I would probably still be applying for jobs  ,48.7,49.09,48.28,48.92,76752400,1

04-10-2019," Bloomberg     When Amin Nasser met investors at the palatial St  Regis hotel in midtown Manhattan last week  the chief executive officer of the world s biggest oil company had one clear message  we re in a league of our own 
After a bruising two years of being buffeted by delays to an initial public offering  investor skepticism over the valuation and profound change within Saudi Arabia  the CEO was here to set Wall Street straight   Saudi Aramco is no ordinary oil company   the 60 year old petroleum engineer told his audience  according to a person who was present 
A week later  it s clear the bankers believed him  Aramco sold  12 billion of bonds yesterday in what was one of the most oversubscribed offerings in history  In an incredibly rare turn  demand was so high that the company was able to borrow at a lower yield than its sovereign parent  More importantly  the sale demonstrated Saudi Arabia s return to the global capitalist fold after being ostracized over the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi last year 
For Nasser  the bond sale is the apotheosis of his career  all the more remarkable because the revelations it brought would have been unthinkable just a few years ago  After decades of secrecy  Aramco has in quick succession revealed its balance sheet  the status of oil fields and the financial relationship with the government  its only shareholder 
Strong Reputation
 Aramco executives have a strong reputation  they are straight shooters   said Jim Krane  an energy research fellow at the Baker Institute at Rice University in Houston   If they say they are going to do something  they do it  
Aramco  which pumps about one in every 10 oil barrels globally  isn t just the world s most profitable company  easily outpacing American titans such as Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL   and JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM    it s also the cash cow sustaining the entire kingdom 
Even with that track record  the task of selling debt was daunting  For the first time in four decades  the company would be answerable to someone other than the government  While Aramco was already regarded as a well run company  comparable to any international competitor  the search for bond investors required a whole new public vocabulary as officials for the first time answered questions on balance sheets and cash flows 
To accomplish the transition  Nasser surrounded himself with a small team of executives  all of whom went from anonymity to Wall Street A list within a week 
Global Roadshow
Among them was Khalid Dabbagh  who became chief financial officer only a year ago  and Motassim al Ma Ashouq  the treasurer who led the preparations for Aramco s now delayed IPO  Both handled most of the global roadshow  according to people familiar with the presentations  who asked not to be identified because the meetings were private  Other senior managers such as Yasser Mufti  the head of strategy  also pitched in 
Collectively  they delivered what Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman presumably wanted  a blockbuster deal  attracting almost  100 billion in orders  that was so sought after it actually reduced overall borrowing costs for the kingdom 
The company s profile combined with investors  hunt for yield in emerging markets made the bond offering irresistible for many  said Jason Bordoff  the director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University in New York  In an era of diminishing or negative yields  Aramco s longest dated bonds received the strongest demand 
Global Community
Those seeking to use the sale as a gauge of Saudi Arabia s rehabilitation into the global community should take that into account  said Karen Young  a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington and a specialist in the political economy of the Middle East   The success of the Aramco bond debut says more about global investor appetite   she said 
Aramco has also deployed an army of investor relations specialists over the past two years  initially focused on the planned IPO and then the bond sale  Fergus MacLeod  formerly head of investors relations at  BP   LON BP  Plc  led the effort with Louise Hough  a 25 year veteran at  Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN  Group AG  and Ruban Chandran  another BP alumni 
Bond Roadshow
The success of the bond roadshow was in contrast to their efforts on the IPO  where most investors balked at the suggested valuation of  2 trillion  While equity investors were anxious about oil prices and dividends  the bond traders cared more about yields and a pristine balance sheet  Aramco was able to deliver on both 
Talks with bond investors accelerated earlier this year as Nasser embarked on several days of back to back meetings on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos  Switzerland  By then  the focus was on the debt sale rather than the IPO  Both would be able to generate the funds needed for the crown prince s agenda of economic and social reform 
For Nasser  perhaps more at ease with Saudi geology than Wall Street finances  the deal is the culmination of a 37 year career that began in the vast oil fields of the desert kingdom  He wound up as the company s chief petroleum engineer before his elevation to the CEO role in 2015  His predecessor  Khalid Al Falih  is the current energy minister 
As Aramco priced the bonds in New York on Tuesday evening  Nasser was back in the kingdom for a dinner with the Society of Petroleum Engineers  Abdullah Jum ah  who ran the company from 1995 to 2009  welcomed him back home as  the  100 billion man  ",49.67,50.19,49.54,50.15,138478800,1

While the U S  and China both scramble to limit losses in their ongoing trade war  Vietnam s Le Duy Anh is adding to his winnings 
Anh is chief executive officer of Xuan Hoa Vietnam Joint Stock Co   a furniture company based outside of Hanoi  which has received an influx of international visitors recently  On the back of U S  China tariffs on  360 billion in goods last year  Xuan Hoa clients    including Swedish furniture giant Ikea    have re directed some production from China to Vietnam  At least 10 new prospective clients came calling at Anh s office from abroad in just the first three months of the year 
 The trade war is bringing more business  for sure   said Anh  who expects sales to at least double in the next five years   There are more companies getting in touch with us to switch from China to our products  
Xuan Hoa has been doing business with Ikea for more than 17 years  and the Swedish furnisher recently started ordering a small  palm sized metal part from the Vietnamese producer  Xuan Hoa s price was already about 1 000 dong  4 cents  cheaper per part than Ikea s Chinese supplier  according to Anh  and could ve potentially widened under a U S  China trade war 
Low Cost
 Like any other growing  global company  Ikea is always seeking competitive opportunities in order to secure optimal sourcing to keep costs low for our customers   Mattias Hennius  a spokesman for Ikea in Sweden  said in an email  without addressing its expanding business with Xuan Hoa specifically 
Vietnam s appeal rests in part on its reputation as a low cost location  A factory worker in Vietnam is paid about half of what his peer gets in China  while electricity is cheap because of government subsidies  Vietnam shares a land border with China  which makes it cheaper and easier for factories to source materials and components for manufacturing 
The trade war is accelerating a trend that s been steadily growing since Vietnam began opening its economy under so called  doi moi  reforms in the 1980s  The economy has evolved into one of the most trade dependent ones in the world with a dozen signed free trade agreements 
Foreign direct investment has steadily increased since then  but really took off in 2014 after Samsung Electronics  KS 005930  Co  announced plans to shift production of its smartphones from China to cushion its profits  FDI reached  14 1 billion in 2017  making up one fifth of all inflows into the region  excluding Singapore  according to data compiled by Maybank Kim Eng Research Ltd 
 It s not just a new toy for people to play with    it s a shiny new toy   Adam Sitkoff  executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hanoi  said of investor enthusiasm in Vietnam 
Vietnam has made strides in the World Bank s Ease of Doing Business gauge and the World Economic Forum s Competitiveness Index  and debuted this year at No  60 in the Bloomberg Innovation Index 
The trade war has acted as an added nudge for businesses to pull the trigger on their Vietnam expansion plans  Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL   supplier GoerTek Inc  of China  and Taiwanese giant Hon Hai Precision Industry Co   known also as Foxconn  as well as some of its rivals have all made moves into the Southeast Asian country amid the trade war  American home furnisher Haverty Furniture Cos Inc  also is ramping up production in Vietnam  citing tariff pressures 
It s showing up in the export numbers too  with Vietnam s shipments holding up as trade elsewhere takes a knock  Exports rose 12 4 percent in the second half of 2018 from a year ago  outpacing the five biggest economies in Southeast Asia  according to data compiled by  HSBC Holdings  Plc  LON HSBA  
 Favorable  View
Investors say Vietnam still has much work to do to improve its business environment  rooting out corruption  improving and expanding infrastructure  especially for transport  and making sure manufacturing can move steadily up the value chain 
Like Southeast Asia s five biggest economies  Vietnam counts China as its top trading partner  making it difficult for the nation to choose sides in a trade war  But for Anh and an overwhelming majority of his fellow Vietnamese  there s a clear bias toward the U S 
Vietnam tops the list among countries whose residents hold an  unfavorable  opinion of China  at 88 percent versus No  2 Japan at 83 percent  according to the Spring 2017 Pew Global Attitudes Survey  Vietnamese affections for the U S     84 percent hold  favorable  opinions of the country    rank behind only that of U S  citizens for their nation  the data show 
For a country that suffered a decades long  brutal war against the U S   referred to domestically as  the American War   Vietnamese enthusiasm to see the U S  as a partner underlines their ambition as an open  internationally connected economy 
Ha Van Thanh  an assembly worker who s been with Xuan Hoa for 22 years  said he doesn t follow the trade war news much  but sees the benefits for Vietnam 
 I believe it s quite good for Vietnam to do business with the U S  as well as the U S  to work with us because many of our products can compete well with Chinese products   he said   The U S  is a good market which we can supply  ",50.21,50.25,49.61,49.74,103272000,1

TAIPEI  Reuters    Foxconn s Chairman Terry Gou said on Tuesday he is considering whether to run for Taiwan s 2020 presidential election  a day after Reuters reported the tycoon planned to step down from the world s largest contract manufacturer 
Speaking on the sidelines of an event in Taipei  Gou declined to say which party he could represent  although any bid could shake up the political playing field at a time of heightened tensions between the self ruled island and Beijing 
If it was the opposition  China friendly Kuomintang  KMT   he would  go  with the standard procedures of the party  Gou said  adding he would make that decision  as soon as possible  
 I didn t sleep last night     2020 is key for Taiwan  The reason for the tense situation  with China  is because it s a turning point for Taiwan s direction for politics  economy  defense for the next 20 years   Gou said 
 So I asked myself the whole night     I need to ask myself what I can do  What I can do for the youth      The next 20 years will decide their fate   he said  his eyes welling up with tears at times 
The KMT said in a statement Gou had been a party member for more than 50 years and had given it an interest free loan of T 45 million   1 5 million  in 2016 under the name of his mother  a move that signaled his  loyalty  to the party 
The KMT did not immediately respond to a media enquiry on whether Gou was eligible to participate in the party s already highly competitive primary election 
Gou  Taiwan s richest person with a net worth of  7 6 billion according to Forbes  told Reuters on Monday he planned to step down in the coming months to pave the way for younger talent to move up the company s ranks 
The company later said Gou will remain chairman of Foxconn  though he plans to withdraw from daily operations 
Taiwan is gearing up for presidential elections in January at a time of heightened tensions across the Taiwan Strait  with Chinese bombers and warships conducting drills around the island on Monday 
A senior U S  official denounced the military maneuvers as  coercion  and a threat to stability in the region 
Some observers said Washington was likely to greet any presidential bid by Gou with caution 
 I don t think the United States would be too happy to see him running because he is close to China and  right now  the U S  is wary about China   said Shane Lee  political scientist at Chang Jung University in Taiwan 
 PEACE IS THE BIGGEST WEAPON 
China claims Taiwan as its own and has vowed to bring the island  which it regards as a sacred territory  under Chinese control  by force if necessary 
The United States has no formal ties with Taiwan but is bound by law to help provide the island with the means to defend itself and is its main source of arms 
 We need peace  We don t need to buy too many weapons  Peace is the biggest weapon   Gou said  adding that Taiwan only needs adequate self defence 
 If we spend the money for weapons on economic development  on artificial intelligence  on investment in the United States  this would be the biggest assurance on peace  
 Whose children are willing to sit in those fighter jets  
A source with direct knowledge of the situation said Gou was likely to announce his decision on the presidential bid later on Tuesday at the earliest and was due to travel to Foxconn s factory in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen on Wednesday 
Shares of Foxconn  which is formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd and has a market value of around  40 billion  closed 0 7 percent higher on Tuesday 
An official at Taiwan s stock exchange told Reuters there were no regulations related to a company executive running for the island s presidency 
Taiwan s pro independence Democratic Progressive  NYSE PGR  Party is expected to announce a presidential candidate in May  with contenders including President Tsai Ing wen and her former premier  William Lai 
FOXCONN MANAGEMENT RESHUFFLE
Asked by Reuters on Monday if he would quit as chairman  Gou said  at 69 years old  he was moving in that direction  though any decision needed to be discussed with Foxconn s board 
 I don t know where you got the information from  But I have to say  basically  I m working towards that direction   to walk back to the second line  or retire   Gou said 
He also signaled a major management reshuffle 
 In the board meeting in April May we will give the new list of board members to the board   Gou said without elaborating 
Founded in 1974  the Foxconn group is the world s biggest contract manufacturer with T 5 2 trillion   168 52 billion  in annual revenue  It assembles goods for a miscellany of global tech firms but relies on Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL  for over half of annual revenue  analysts said ",49.87,50.34,49.64,49.81,102785600,1

NEW DELHI MUMBAI  Reuters    An Indian ban on downloading TikTok  one of the world s most popular mobile applications  has heightened industry worries that technology companies could now face increased scrutiny and regulatory challenges in one of their most important markets 
TikTok  which allows users to create and share videos with special effects  has become a sensation in India  where it has been downloaded by nearly 300 million users so far  according to analytics firm Sensor Tower  out of more than 1 billion installs globally 
Its runaway popularity has attracted criticism from some politicians  however  in a largely conservative society that can have a low boiling point for even moderately racey content 
In the case of TikTok  15 second dance clips and memes dominate the platform  although some videos do show youngsters  some scantily clad  lip syncing and grooving to popular tunes  Local media have also reported several accidental deaths when users attempted to make videos with knives and guns 
The IT minister of Tamil Nadu state  M  Manikandan  said in February that  young girls and everybody is behaving very badly  on TikTok 
On Wednesday  TikTok vanished from Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  and Apple s app stores in India  The rare takedown of such a popular app came after the Madras High Court said the app encouraged pornography and asked the government to ban it  The federal IT ministry then issued a follow up directive to Google and Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  
Industry executives  technology lawyers and free speech activists interviewed by Reuters on Wednesday said the ban was a major concern 
 It does unnerve me   said a senior executive working for a social media company in New Delhi   For the industry  it sets a worrying precedent in India  
A TikTok spokesman said on Wednesday that it had faith in the judicial system and was  optimistic about an outcome that would be well received by  its millions of users in India  The state court will next hear the case on April 24 
Google told Reuters late on Tuesday it does not comment on individual apps but adheres to local laws  Apple did not respond to requests for comment 
CRITICAL MARKET
TikTok is not the first social media company to run into trouble in India 
Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and its messenger app WhatsApp  which count India as their biggest market  have been under pressure from authorities to better tackle fake news and monitor content on their platforms 
Global video streaming giant Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  was dragged into a legal battle last year following a complaint that one of its fictional series insulted a former Indian prime minister 
But industry executives said the ruling against TikTok was particularly worrisome  given that it originated from a public interest complaint brought by an individual in Tamil Nadu   opening their digital content to judicial scrutiny that could potentially derail their India strategy overnight 
 It shows a level of uncertainty which is not great for investors  for private equity firms and for venture capital   said Apar Gupta  executive director at advocacy group Internet Freedom Foundation 
India is a critical market for social media and mobile digital content companies as the country is witnessing a sharp surge in use of smartphones  An estimated half a billion Indians now have access to the Internet 
Singapore based Bigo  which has a live video streaming app  has also been expanding in India  TikTok s owner Bytedance Technology Co  one of the world s most valuable start ups  also runs another social app named Helo  which allows users to share content in local languages 
Bytedance has more than 250 employees in India  with plans to expand further  one of its court filings showed  It had about two dozen India job openings listed on LinkedIn  NYSE LNKD  as of Wednesday 
SEXUAL PREDATORS
Such is the TikTok craze that a Reuters photographer recently saw more than a dozen youngsters shooting TikTok videos on their smartphones at a popular Mumbai promenade  While some danced as they lip synced to songs  others used teddy bears as props 
The Tamil Nadu court  which ruled against TikTok  said inappropriate content was its dangerous aspect and that the app could expose children to sexual predators 
The ban does not apply to use of the TikTok app if it has already been downloaded 
The Chinese company unsuccessfully argued at the Supreme Court last week that a ban  amounts to curtailing of the  free speech  rights of the citizens of India  
A  very minuscule  proportion of TikTok s videos were considered inappropriate or obscene  the company said in its Supreme Court filing  adding that it was primarily an entertainment platform 
That argument cut no ice with the app s critics  however 
Hindu nationalist group Swadeshi Jagaran Manch  which is close to India s ruling party and had previously criticized the app s content  on Wednesday welcomed the ban  saying TikTok was  against Indian culture and morality  
It also struck a chord in some family living rooms in India 
 From small kids to old ladies  it is spoiling the minds of everyone   said S  Nithyajothi  a homemaker from the southern city of Madurai   I strictly ask anyone coming to my house to not talk about TikTok  it is addictive and it is unnecessary  ",49.88,50.85,49.65,50.78,115627200,-1

04-17-2019," Bloomberg     China is drafting a series of stimulus measures to bolster sales of cars and electronics  according to people familiar with the matter 
The draft includes subsidies for new energy vehicles  smartphones and home appliances  said the people  who asked not to be named because they aren t authorized to discuss the plan  The proposals are at a consultation stage with other government branches  and there is no guarantee that they ll be approved  the people said  The National Development and Reform Commission  which is said to have drafted the plan  didn t immediately respond to a fax seeking comment 
The move indicates Chinese leaders are stepping up attempts to bolster consumption and mitigate the threats posed by trade tensions with the U S  The government  which already unveiled its most ambitious tax reduction in years  is seeing some signs its efforts are bearing fruit  retail sales expanded 8 7 percent in March to beat expectations  and first quarter gross domestic product expanded more than economists estimated 
Speculation over the stimulus swirled in the markets Wednesday  pushing up shares of domestic carmakers such as BYD Co  and automakers in Europe  The Stoxx Europe 600 Automobiles   Parts Index rose 1 8 percent to an intraday high  led by Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  AG   Daimler  AG  DE DAIGn  and Faurecia SA  General Motors Co  NYSE GM   rose in pre market trading in the U S  Home appliance maker Electrolux AB also rose 
It s notoriously difficult to own a car in major Chinese cities because of quotas put in place to tackle traffic congestion and air pollution  In Beijing  the annual new vehicle quota dropped to 100 000 in 2018  and each licensed gasoline fueled car has to be idle one day a week  That s prompted the government to provide incentives for motorists to drive new energy vehicles    including pure battery electrics  plug in hybrids and fuel cell cars 
Existing ownership restrictions have hindered the growth of car sales  Cui Dongshu  secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association  said in February  In Beijing and Shanghai  for example  drivers wanting a license plate for a gasoline powered car must enter a years long lottery or pay as much as 90 000 yuan 
China s auto market has been shrinking for months as it goes through its worst slump in a generation  Also  sales during the first half of this year are seeing downward pressure because a cut in purchasing taxes in 2016 and 2017 prompted many consumers to buy vehicles sooner than planned  John Zeng  managing director of LMC Automotive Shanghai  said in February 
Trading in old phones for new ones also would be subsidized under the plan  according to the people  That could help the smartphone industry rebound after shipments declined 9 7 percent in the fourth quarter to 103 million units  according to International Data Corp  The leading domestic brands include Huawei  Oppo  Vivo and Xiaomi  with Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL   being the only overseas maker ranked in the top five in sales 
The plan also calls for a subsidy of as much as 13 percent on home appliances  setting a maximum of 800 yuan per product  according to the people  Online and offline sales for January and February as reported by China Market Monitor were lackluster  The leading local brands include Gree  Haier and Midea

04-23-2019," Bloomberg     Japan s Heisei era began three decades ago with a new emperor ascending the throne near the zenith of one of the biggest stock price bubbles in history  It s been punctuated by the triple hit of an earthquake  tsunami and nuclear meltdown  the fall of tech icons and the rise of automotive giants  and by creeping social change that s seeing women and foreigners playing a bigger role in economic life  As the monarch prepares to step down this month in the midst of a radical monetary experiment to jolt the economy back on track  here is a series of charts that highlight key changes 
It takes a comparison with the collapse of U S  stocks that ushered in the Great Depression to put the magnitude of Japan s asset price implosion in true perspective  What s most shocking is the failure of Japanese shares to regain their highs  even after 30 years  while the Dow surged back in the 1950s  The weakness in Japanese stocks has mirrored wider problems  which set the stage for Japan to slip to third place in the global economic pecking order 
Some of Japan s greatest corporate names have also suffered  like Sony Corp  T 6758   The Tokyo based consumer electronics champion swept all before it with products like the Walkman portable cassette player until analogue gave way to digital  and the rise of Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL   and South Korea s Samsung Electronics  KS 005930  Co  Others including Sharp Corp  and Panasonic Corp  have seen their value slide from great heights 
Yet through it all  investors around the world have turned to the yen for safety in times of crisis  Ultra low interest rates encourage investors to borrow in Japan and put the money to work in other economies that are growing more  When risks rise  these same investors run for the exits  where they are forced to buy up yen to unwind their so called carry trades  The country also remains a huge exporter and despite high government debt    which has risen to a whopping 230 percent of GDP during the Heisei era    corporate Japan continues to drive current account surpluses  which support the currency 
Japan has also maintained its dominant position as the world s top creditor nation  offsetting worries about government debt and boosting confidence in the yen  It owns more than  1 trillion of U S  Treasuries  slightly less than China s hoard of American debt  and its big commercial banks are among the leading lenders in Asia 
Japan s car industry has extended its reach  dueling for pole position with European giants while U S  competitors suffered setbacks  Toyota stands head and shoulders above most brands in the world and has led the way with hybrid vehicles as auto manufacturers chart a course to an electric future  Its dozens of factories around the world are also testament to the international expansion of corporate Japan  which repatriates profits from abroad  even as growth ebbs in the domestic market 
The struggle for gender equality was slow to arrive in Japan but has received strong impetus from the labor shortage that s taken hold in recent years  Women have poured into work    though mostly part time and contract positions    to the point that Japan s female labor force participation rate is now higher than that of the U S  With more working role models for girls  there are hopes that the Reiwa era beginning on May 1 will see women take the next step up the ladder  Women s share of leadership roles in government and the private sector remains low  despite talk of  womenomics  polices under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe  whose government quietly gave up on a goal of getting women into 30 percent of management positions by 2020 
Japan s population has fallen for the last nine years and one in three people are now age 60 or older  The challenge this presents to the economy is enormous as businesses lose both customers and workers  undermining the incentive to invest at home  and the government faces rising welfare costs and a declining pool of taxpayers to support the system  The problem is playing out dramatically for monetary policy makers  who ve been buying up bonds and stocks and slashing borrowing costs in an effort to steer inflation higher and reinvigorate the economy  In a move that turned conventional policy on its head  the Bank of Japan cut interest rates to zero in 1999 and 20 years later the BOJ is holding its key short term rate at minus 0 1 percent 
All this monetary firepower hasn t fixed Japan s low inflation  low growth problem  Yet as the Heisei period comes to end  Japan s detractors are growing quiet  It turns out that much of the developed world is also losing the battle to spur price gains  In a bout of introspection  the Federal Reserve has declared 2019 a year of strategy review while some pundits are even taking about  Japanification  in Europe s stuttering economy  Meanwhile  as demographics pushes Japan to slowly let more overseas workers in  the is U S  taking steps to limit use of H 1B visas    keeping more high skilled foreigners out ",51.11,51.94,50.97,51.87,93292000,1

04-24-2019,"By Jeffrey Dastin and Heather Somerville SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    Hollywood has a new suitor in Silicon Valley  Airbnb Inc  the high flying startup for booking home rentals around the world  has ambitions to develop a slate of original shows to whet customers  appetite for travel  four people familiar with the matter told Reuters  The strategy  previously unreported  is crucial for the company  which is privately valued at  31 billion and is gearing up for an initial public offering of stock expected next year  Airbnb must distinguish itself from Booking  NASDAQ BKNG  com   Expedia   NASDAQ EXPE  and others in the fiercely competitive and consolidating travel industry  where apartment renting services are increasingly common  Chief Executive Brian Chesky is driving the idea  three of the people said  arguing that creative content is important for Airbnb s brand even if the business case is not always clear   Brian wants to create a studio   one of the people said  The mentality   Let s do shows  Let s do films  because we want to be travel everything   Chesky  who co founded the company   likes big splashy things   another person said  For at least three years  Airbnb has batted around ideas for creating or licensing mini series and documentaries about travel  and shows featuring Airbnb homes  guests and hosts  one of the people said  It has discussed working with studios as well as starting its own   GRAPHIC  Airbnb in the spotlight     The company has worked on a television show slated for Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  Inc s upcoming streaming service   Home   a docuseries featuring unique abodes around the world and the people behind them  One executive producer of the show is Joe Poulin  a company vice president who ran Luxury Retreats when Airbnb acquired the booking site in 2017  Airbnb announced last week it had developed and produced the documentary  Gay Chorus Deep South   which follows the San Francisco Gay Men s Chorus on a tour across the Southeastern United States  and will premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival next week  Airbnb told Reuters it provided funding for the project  In an interview  Airbnb s top policy and communications executive  Chris Lehane  said the company is considering streaming films and shows through its app as well as through other video platforms   We re very much in the R D phase here   said Lehane   It s not just limited to video  It could be audible  It could be physical    The more we put content out there  the more you re going to bring people to the platform   he said  Original shows could also entice customers even before they have decided where to go on vacation and demystify Airbnb for travelers  including Wall Street investors  who have stuck to familiar hotel chains   Graphic on how Airbnb stacks up against its venture backed peers    TECH INDUSTRY PLAYBOOK Airbnb has yet to cement all the details related to its timeline  program financing or even lineup  Its work so far has ranged from the Tribeca documentary to a YouTube show about travel trends and other video marketing efforts  Offering original content and other media is an increasingly popular strategy in Silicon Valley  where technology companies are desperate for deeper relationships with internet users and their lucrative data  Apple last month unveiled a TV streaming service and joined a long list of companies attracted to Hollywood s glitter  including Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN  and even Walmart  NYSE WMT  Inc  The big box retailer had said it will partner with U S  movie studio Metro Goldwyn Mayer to make content for its video on demand service  Vudu  Such bets are expensive  but often justified by executives for their marketing value  Airbnb said its network of half a billion travelers is drawing partners who wish to produce and finance content for the company  Airbnb s original magazine remains central to this effort  Published by media conglomerate Hearst since May 2017  the Airbnb Magazine will be a jumping off point for other content that the company develops  It is the darling of CEO Chesky  something the billionaire founder hopes will become a collector s item like old print editions of  Rolling Stone   Lehane said  Films and streaming content would mark the next iteration of a business that has steadily expanded to get customers to use its app for more parts of their travel experience  Airbnb added restaurant reservations and said it would branch into transportation services  so customers remain in its orbit long after they have picked a place to stay  The company even explored building its own flight booking feature and acquiring travel fare aggregator Skyscanner before retreating from that idea  said another person with knowledge of the matter  A key player in the video effort is Kim Kingsley  co founder of news site Politico  Kingsley joined Airbnb last summer and is in charge of the firm s content strategy  according to her LinkedIn  NYSE LNKD  profile  Meanwhile  Airbnb s magazine lead  Ben Kasman  has helped grow the publication to more than a million readers  Even by technology startups  standards  Airbnb is not afraid to spend large sums on marketing  It hired Ready State  a high end agency in San Francisco  whose employees flew to Europe to create videos for Airbnb  The firm was also hired to promote tours sold on Airbnb s website  known as  Experiences   even though many of those are cheap  
 It s all part of the efforts to broaden the base   said one person close to the company   to make what they do more mainstream  ",51.84,52.12,51.76,51.79,70162400,1

Alphabet s quarterly costs rose about the same as revenue  up 16 5 percent from last year to  29 7 billion  Expenses have surged faster than revenue for much of the past two years as it adds data centers  offices and YouTube content licenses  concerning some investors amid increased scrutiny on the company s privacy practices and the advertising restrictions at YouTube   More advertising controls are coming to YouTube in the coming weeks that could affect sales  Pichai said  In the first quarter  sales of Google s Pixel phones also struggled from intense competition in the premium
