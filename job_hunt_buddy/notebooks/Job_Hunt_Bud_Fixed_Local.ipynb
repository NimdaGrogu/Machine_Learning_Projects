Here\\u2019s a summary of the main components of the protocol:\\n\\n1. **Early Identification and Empiric Antibiotic Therapy**: Immediate administration of parenteral antibiotics after obtaining specimens for Gram stain and culture is crucial. This very prompt empiric therapy is essential and can be lifesaving. The choice of antibiotics should be based on the suspected source of infection, clinical setting, knowledge or suspicion of causative organisms, sensitivity patterns common to the specific inpatient unit, and previous culture results. For septic shock of unknown cause, a regimen might include gentamicin or tobramycin combined with a 3rd-generation cephalosporin, or alternatives like ceftazidime plus a fluoroquinolone.\\n\\n2. **Adjustment Based on Culture Results**: Once culture and sensitivity results are available, the antibiotic regimen should be adjusted accordingly. Antibiotics are generally continued for at least 5 days after the resolution of shock and evidence of infection subsides.\\n\\n3. **Management of Complications and Source Control**: It is critical to drain abscesses and surgically excise necrotic tissues such as infarcted bowel or gangrenous gallbladder. The patient\\u2019s condition will continue to deteriorate despite antibiotic therapy unless septic foci are eliminated.\\n\\n4. **Supportive Care**:\\n   - **Blood Glucose Management**: Normalization of blood glucose levels is important, with a target range of 80 to 110 mg/dL. This is typically managed with a continuous IV insulin infusion, requiring frequent glucose monitoring.\\n   - **Corticosteroid Therapy**: This may be beneficial in managing sepsis, using replacement doses of corticosteroids (e.g., hydrocortisone) during hemodynamic instability and for a few days thereafter.\\n   - **Activated Protein C**: For severe cases, especially in patients with a high risk of death (APACHE II score > 25), activated protein C (drotrecogin alfa) may be used, although it carries a risk of bleeding and requires careful risk-benefit assessment.\\n\\n5. **Emerging Therapies**: Other treatments under consideration for severe sepsis include cooling for hyperthermia and early treatment of renal failure, such as continuous venovenous hemofiltration.\\n\\nThis protocol emphasizes the importance of rapid and aggressive treatment, tailored antimicrobial therapy based on empirical and culture-driven data, and comprehensive supportive care to manage systemic effects and complications of sepsis.

Contrast-. \\u2022 Surgical removal\\n\\u2022 IV fluids and antibiotics\\nTreatment of acute appendicitis is open or laparoscopic appendectomy; because treatment delay\\nincreases mortality, a negative appendectomy rate of 15% is considered acceptable. The surgeon can\\nusually remove the appendix even if perforated. Occasionally, the appendix is difficult to locate: In these\\ncases, it usually lies behind the cecum or the ileum and mesentery of the right colon. A contraindication to\\nappendectomy is inflammatory bowel disease involving the cecum. However, in cases of terminal ileitis\\nand a normal cecum, the appendix should be removed.\\nAppendectomy should be preceded by IV antibiotics. Third-generation cephalosporins are preferred. For\\nnonperforated appendicitis, no further antibiotics are required. If the appendix is perforated, antibiotics\\nshould be continued until the patient's temperature and WBC count have normalized or continued for a\\nfixed course, according to the surgeon's preference. If surgery is impossible, antibiotics\\u2014although not\\ncurative\\u2014markedly improve the survival rate. When a large inflammatory mass is found involving the\\nappendix, terminal ileum, and cecum, resection of the entire mass and ileocolostomy are preferable. In\\nlate cases in which a pericolic abscess has already formed, the abscess is drained either by an\\nultrasound-guided percutaneous catheter or by open operation (with appendectomy to follow at a later\\ndate). A Meckel's diverticulum in a patient under the age of 40 should be removed concomitantly with the\\nappendectomy unless extensive inflammation around the appendix prevents the procedure.\\nHernias of the Abdominal Wall\\nA hernia of the abdominal wall is a protrusion of the abdominal contents through an acquired or\\ncongenital area of weakness or defect in the wall.

Treatment is elective surgical repair.\\nAbdominal hernias are extremely common, particularly among males, necessitating about 700,000\\noperations each year in the US.\\nClassification\\nAbdominal hernias are classified as either abdominal wall or groin hernias. Strangulated hernias are\\nischemic from physical constriction of their blood supply. Gangrene, perforation, and peritonitis may. occur. Pain may not be localized, particularly in infants and children. Tenderness may be diffuse or, in rare\\ninstances, absent. Bowel movements are usually less frequent or absent; if diarrhea is a sign, a\\nretrocecal appendix should be suspected. RBCs or WBCs may be present in the urine. Atypical symptoms\\nare common among elderly patients and pregnant women; in particular, pain is less severe and local\\ntenderness is less marked.\\nDiagnosis\\n\\u2022 Clinical evaluation\\n\\u2022 Abdominal CT if necessary\\n\\u2022 Ultrasound an option to CT\\nWhen classic symptoms and signs are present, the diagnosis is clinical. In such patients, delaying\\nlaparotomy to do imaging tests only increases the likelihood of perforation and subsequent complications.\\nIn patients with atypical or equivocal findings, imaging studies should be done without delay. Contrast-\\nenhanced CT has reasonable accuracy in diagnosing appendicitis and can also reveal other causes of\\nan acute abdomen. Graded compression ultrasound can usually be done quickly and uses no radiation\\n(of particular concern in children); however, it is occasionally limited by the presence of bowel gas and is\\nless useful for recognizing nonappendiceal causes of pain. Appendicitis remains primarily a clinical\\ndiagnosis. Selective and judicious use of radiographic studies may reduce the rate of negative\\nlaparotomy.\\nLaparoscopy can be used for diagnosis as well as definitive treatment; it may be especially helpful in\\nwomen with lower abdominal pain of unclear etiology. Laboratory studies typically show leukocytosis\\n(12,000 to 15,000/\\u03bcL), but this finding is highly variable; a normal WBC count should not be used to\\nexclude appendicitis.\\nPrognosis\\nWithout surgery or antibiotics, mortality is > 50%.\\nWith early surgery, the mortality rate is < 1%, and convalescence is normally rapid and complete. With\\ncomplications (rupture and development of an abscess or peritonitis), the prognosis is worse: Repeat\\noperations and a long convalescence may follow.\\nTreatment\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 11.

Traumatic Brain Injury\\nIntroduction\\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI) is physical injury to brain tissue that temporarily or permanently\\nimpairs brain function. Diagnosis is suspected clinically and confirmed by imaging (primarily\\nCT). Initial treatment consists of ensuring a reliable airway and maintaining adequate\\nventilation, oxygenation, and blood pressure. Surgery is often needed in patients with more\\nsevere injury to place monitors to track and treat intracranial pressure, decompress the brain if\\nintracranial pressure is increased, or remove intracranial hematomas. In the first few days after\\nthe injury, maintaining adequate brain perfusion and oxygenation and preventing complications\\nof altered sensorium are important. Subsequently, many patients require rehabilitation.\\nIn the US, as in much of the world, TBI is a common cause of death and disability. Causes include motor\\nvehicle crashes and other transportation-related causes (eg, bicycle crashes, collisions with pedestrians),\\nfalls (especially in older adults and young children), assaults, and sports activities.\\nPathology\\nStructural changes from head injury may be gross or microscopic, depending on the mechanism and\\nforces involved. Patients with less severe injuries may have no gross structural damage. Clinical\\nmanifestations vary markedly in severity and consequences. Injuries are commonly categorized as open\\nor closed.\\nOpen injuries involve penetration of the scalp and skull (and usually the meninges and underlying brain\\ntissue). They typically involve bullets or sharp objects, but a skull fracture with overlying laceration due to\\nsevere blunt force is also considered an open injury.\\nClosed injuries typically occur when the head is struck, strikes an object, or is shaken violently, causing\\nrapid brain acceleration and deceleration. Acceleration or deceleration can injure tissue at the point of\\nimpact (coup), at its opposite pole (contrecoup), or diffusely; the frontal and temporal lobes are\\nparticularly vulnerable. Axons, blood vessels, or both can be sheared or torn. Disrupted blood vessels\\nleak, causing contusions, intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage, and epidural or subdural\\nhematomas (see\\nTable 324-1).\\nConcussion: Concussion is defined as a transient and reversible posttraumatic alteration in mental\\nstatus (eg, loss of consciousness or memory) lasting from seconds to minutes and, by arbitrary definition,. regardless of severity and continue to improve for a longer period of time.\\nCognitive deficits, with impaired concentration, attention, and memory, and various personality changes\\nare a more common cause of disability in social relations and employment than are focal motor or sensory\\nimpairments. Posttraumatic anosmia and acute traumatic blindness seldom resolve after 3 to 4 mo.\\nHemiparesis and aphasia usually resolve at least partially, except in the elderly.\\nTreatment\\n\\u2022 For mild injuries discharge and observation\\n\\u2022 For moderate and severe injuries optimization of ventilation, oxygenation, and brain perfusion; treatment\\nof complications (eg, increased ICP, seizures, hematomas); and rehabilitation\\nMultiple noncranial injuries, which are likely with motor vehicle crashes and falls, often require\\nsimultaneous treatment. Initial resuscitation of trauma patients is discussed elsewhere (see p. 3190).\\nAt the injury scene, a clear airway is secured and external bleeding is controlled before the patient is\\nmoved. Particular care is taken to avoid displacement of the spine or other bones to protect the spinal\\ncord and blood vessels. Proper immobilization should be maintained with a cervical collar and long spine\\nboard until stability of the entire spine has been established by appropriate examination and imaging (see\\np. 3229). After the initial rapid neurologic assessment, pain should be relieved with a short-acting opioid\\n(eg, fentanyl).\\nIn the hospital, after quick initial evaluation, neurologic findings (GCS and pupillary reaction), BP, pulse,\\nand temperature should be recorded frequently for several hours because any deterioration demands\\nprompt attention. Serial GCS and CT results stratify injury severity, which helps guide treatment (see\\nTable 324-4).\\nThe cornerstone of management for all patients is maintenance of adequate ventilation, oxygenation, and\\nbrain perfusion to avoid secondary brain insult. Aggressive early management of hypoxia, hypercapnia,\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 324.

Patients with severe cognitive dysfunction require extensive cognitive therapy, which\\nis often begun immediately after injury and continued for months or years.\\nSpinal cord injury: Specific rehabilitation therapy varies depending on the patient's abnormalities, which\\ndepend on the level and extent (partial or complete) of the injury (see Ch. 325, particularly\\nTable 325-1 on p. 3228). Complete transsection causes flaccid paralysis; partial transsection causes\\nspastic paralysis of muscles innervated by the affected segment. A patient's functional capacity depends\\non the level of injury (see p.\\n1805) and the development of complications (eg, joint contractures, pressure ulcers, pneumonia).\\nThe affected area must be immobilized surgically or nonsurgically as soon as possible and throughout the\\nacute phase. During the acute phase, daily routine care should include measures to prevent contractures,\\npressure ulcers, and pneumonia; all measures needed to prevent other complications (eg, orthostatic\\nhypotension, atelectasis, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) should also be taken.
