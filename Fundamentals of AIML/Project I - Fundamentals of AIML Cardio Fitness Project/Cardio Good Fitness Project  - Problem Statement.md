## Best Practices for Notebook

The notebook should be well-documented, with inline comments explaining the functionality of code and markdown cells
containing comments on the observations and insights. The notebook should be run from start to finish in a sequential
manner before submission. It is preferable to remove all warnings and errors before submission. The notebook should be
submitted as an HTML file (.html) and NOT as a notebook file (.ipynb).
